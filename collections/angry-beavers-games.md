## 3 Man Go! ##
Cricket's favourite game - people talk for each other... player 1 is the voice for player 2, player 2 for 3, and 3 for 1. Play a scene by moving your lips and hoping to God the person being your voice says something intelligible, applicable, and doable. Then when the person you're talking for moves their lips, try to screw them over :)

## 3-Headed Singer ##
Three players sing out a song, singing only one word each at a time.

## A Day in the Life ##
Three events of an audience member's day are suggested, and the scene is based one their day, with extreme justifications.

## Alphabet Game ##
Starting with a letter of the alphabet, each successive line begins with the next letter in the alphabet, until the first letter is repeated.

## Arms Interview ##

## Audience Fantasy ##
Based on an audience member's most embarrassing moment, the scene is played once the way it was described, then again with the best possible outcome.

## Bucket Game ##
One player's head is always in a bucket of water, they get replaced when their hand is tagged, and they take on the character of the player who tagged them in.

## Chain Murder Endowment ##
Also known as C.M.E. for short. This game consists of one improvver being given three suggestions: An occupation, a room, and a murder weapon. It is then the job of the first improvver to pass on this information in a scene without using any known language. After the information is passed on, the first improvver is killed, and the next improvver must pass on the information they have gathered to the next person waiting to play.

## Complaints Department ##
The origin of this game is a little foggy- but it somehow came out of the team's morbid love for endowment games. In this game, there are three 'customers' and a complaints department 'clerk'. The 'clerk' leaves the room and the audience chooses a fictional store for the three customers to complain about. The clerk then returns and the customers come up in turn to register complaints about their items. The object of the game is similar to Pawn Shop. The clerk must guess what the store is/ what it sells based on the hints the customers give in their complaints.

## Dating Game ##
Three lucky "bachelors" each with their own quirk that is selected by the audience answer questions, and try to win our lucky bachelorette's heart.

## Dead Bodies ##
This game consists of up to five improvvers. At least three of these improvvers will be "dead bodies", and remain listless throughout the scene. The other two improvvers will act out a scene, using the other three as their characters.

## Die! ##
Three improvvers stand in a line with a fourth sitting in front of them (back to the audience). The fourth person ("the pointer"), essentially conducts the 3 improvvers in the telling of a story as selected by the audience. The storytellers must not start their sentence with "and", "but" or a long pause (or any other preposition, if you want to be complex), or they must suffer death by pantomimed "audience suggestion".

## Exits and Entrances ##
(AKA 'Zits and 'Trances) All players receive words which key them to leave the scene or enter the scene, and justify it.

## Freeze ##
A scene carries on until someone (even the audience) yells 'freeze'. The scene freezes and the caller enters, replacing one improvver, keeping the same positions, but changing the scene entirely.

## Half Life ##
Two or more improvvers perform a scene in 30 seconds. Then they must perform the same scene in full detail in only 15 seconds. Then in 7 seconds. Then in 3 seconds.

## Half Life go Slow! ##
Backwards half life... instead of starting with 30 seconds and going slower, start with 15 seconds and increase the time up to 2 minutes (second time around is in 30 seconds, then 1 minute... you get the idea).

## Hats ##
Players enter, giving examples of jobs/people/dates using a prop box of hats.

## Pawn Shop ##

## Puppets ##
Two players play a scene, only able to move by how two audience volunteers move their limbs and bodies for them.

## Questions Only ##
Two sides play continual scenes, if a player gives a line that is not a question, a new player from their side replaces them.

## Scripts ##
Two people act out a scene. One person is the "straight man/woman" and the other person has a script, and must only speak by using lines from said script.

## Should Have Said ##
During scene, the host calls 'should have said', and the most recent line must be replaced by the player with an opposite or different line.

## Sign Language Interpreter ##

## Study in the Library ##
One member of the team approaches the library desk and asks to book a room. Once the task is complete, the rest of the team follows the first team member to the booked room and everyone sits at the table, arguing about who gets to plug into the internet and whether or not any studying is getting done. Rinse and repeat as necessary.

## Switch ##
During a scene, off-stage player says 'switch', then the players rotate their characters and positions. Off-stage players can walk in, bringing more characters to rotate through, until all players are in the scene, and rotating through.

## VCR ##
Two players act out a movie while a third player controls the remote for the scene. Rewind, pause, change channels, etc.

## Waiting Game ##
This is a game that Ben2 came across in one of his theatre books, and we've basically turned it into "our game". Three improvvers are all waiting for something. Each improvver is given a suggestion for what they are waiting for, without the other two improvvers knowing. They then preform a scene acting as if they are all waiting for the same thing. It ends with the three improvvers guessing what each other was in the scene.

## World's Worst ##
All the players line up and the host collects suggestions from the audience for mundane every day jobs. The host then reads off one of the audience suggestions.If they have an idea, one (or more) player(s) will step forward to give a short example of the world's worst "whatever the audience suggested".

## Zulu ##
The audience give suggestions for consumer products, and the improvvers must step forward and preform a badly done commercial for each product that the host says.
