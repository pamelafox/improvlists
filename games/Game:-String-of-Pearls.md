This is a group storytelling game, where you begin with the first and last lines of a story, and then fill in the middle. 

Directions:
* Everyone starts off sitting or in some audience form. 
* Someone goes to the stage and stands on the leftmost side. They say the first line of the story (whatever they make up).
* Another person goes up to the stage and stands on the rightmost side. The first person says the first line again, and **then** the new person says the last line of the story (whatever they make up).
* A new person goes up to the stage and stands anywhere between the two people. Once again, the first person repeats the first line, then the new person says their line, then the final person says their line.
* This continues until all the people are standing in the line and hopefully the story plot is filled in!

Notes:
People will often want to run up and immediately say their line, but its important to always start from the beginning. One person can stay out of the game and act as Director, if it helps.
You can start off with picking a genre, like Wild Wild West or Space Opera - that can be fun and help to focus the story.

Variant:
After you come up with a story, all the players can then act it out and attempt to hit every line.
