A good game to practice being on the spot and coming up with things to say. (Same mechanics as "Instruction Manual").

Directions:
1. Around 4 players go up on stage, and one other player nearby will be the "pointer".
2. The players get a suggestion from the audience for a story title.
3. The pointer points at one player and they start talking. The pointer then points at another player, who starts from where the last person got cut off, and they keep talking. 
5. End the story whenever you think is a good time.

Notes: You can also break it up into "Chapter 1", "Chapter 2", "Last Chapter", etc.
