A surprisingly mind-boggling group coordination game. A good practice in paying a lot of attention to all of your fellow improv players.

Directions:
1. Everyone stands in a circle.
2. The leader explains "I'm going to pass taps to either my left or right, and your job is to pass it along in that direction. It'll seem basic at first, but trust, it'll get tricky soon."
3. The leader starts by tapping the right hand person on the shoulder. They should then tap their right hand person on the shoulder, etc, until the leader receives a tap from the left.
4. Then the leader taps the left hand person on the shoulder and waits for it to return.
5. Then the leader taps the right hand person in the middle of the back and waits for it to return.
5. Then the leader taps the left hand person in the middle of the back and waits for it to return.
6. Then the leader taps the right hand person on their foot (i.e. sliding the foot until it nudges theirs) and waits for it to return.
6. Then the leader taps the left hand person on their foot and waits for it to return.
7. Now the leader announces "I'm going to pass all of them, and count how many I get back." 
8. The leader passes the 6 taps, rapidly one after another.
9. The leader keeps track of how many taps they get back. They can keep track in their head or on the fingers of each of their hands.
10. Once there's no more movement, the leader announces how many they got back. 
11. Assuming that the leader didn't get all 6 back the first time, the group tries again until they finally send them all. The leader can provide this tip: "When you pass a tap, watch to see if your neighbor passes it. If they missed your tap, just pass it again."
12. At any point, the leader can ask everyone to switch places, so that different people get to experience being in the center versus being near the leader.
13. Now the leader puts on a song with a very obvious constant beat (like a hip hop song). They explain: "Now you can only pass the tap on a beat." The leader can help by snapping or clapping to the beat.
14. The leader now passes taps constantly, whenever they'd like. It's no longer about how many they receive back, it's just about the coordination of receiving and passing on beats.
15. The game ends when everyone's mind explodes (or if it seems like it's actually working!).
