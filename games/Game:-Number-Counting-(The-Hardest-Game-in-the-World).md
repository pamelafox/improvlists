A fun group coordination game. Or telepathy game, however you think the world works. 

Directions:
1. Everyone sits in a circle and closes their eyes.
2. Anyone starts by saying "1".
3. Now someone else needs to say "2". There's no order, so it could be anyone in the circle. However, if 2 people say "2" at once, the whole circle starts again at "1".
4. Once you've successfully made it to 20, you've won the game!

Notes: You might not ever make it, it's a hard game. This game leads to a nice discussion after about what makes it hard.
