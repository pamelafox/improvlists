A get-to-know-you warmup game.

Directions:
1. Set up chairs in a circle for all but one person in the group.
2. The one person without a chair stands in the middle of the circle.
3. The standing person says something true about their self, like "I love chocolate chip ice cream" or "I was born in California".
4. For each person that it's also true for, they get up from their chairs and try to sit in a new chair (not right next to them!).
5. One person will remain standing, and the game continues.
