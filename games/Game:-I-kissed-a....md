These directions are for the practice version of this game. This can also be done as a performance piece, once players feel comfortable making puns on the spot.

Directions:
1. Everyone sit or stand in a circle.
2. Warmup round: The leader announces a category, like "phone". Then everyone talks at once, naming words related to that category ("screen", "reception", "messages", etc).
3. The leader gives an example pun: "I kissed a phone, but then he sprinted away!". 
4. Popcorn style, players in the circle say their puns. The leader encourages everyone to say them confidently and to emphasize the punniness in them. Punning is as much about wordplay as it is about delivery.
5. When it seems like people are out of pun ideas, the leader asks for examples of words that people couldn't successfully make a pun out of, and encourages the circle to come up with a pun for each of those hard words.
6. Continue with new categories for a few rounds.
