This is a warm-up that helps you practice acting without the influence of others.

Directions:
1. The leader directs everyone to find a place in the room where they have space to themselves, and then to close their eyes.
2. The leader calls out a word and encourages them to move their body in some way inspired by that word, like "graveyard" or "slime". 
3. After a few rounds of that, the leader directs everyone to face a part of the wall, not too close to others. They can close their eyes or open them, up to them.
4. The leader calls out a word and encourages them to embody a character based on that word, and to silently act out that character while facing the wall.
5. After a few rounds of that, the leader calls out a word and encourages everyone to embody a character inspired by that word *and* start speaking a monologue to the wall.
6. After a few rounds of that, the leader tells everyone they can leave the wall and interact with others, as their characters.
