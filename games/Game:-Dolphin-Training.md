A surprisingly hilarious yet simple game. Use in groups that are comfortable with performing for each other.

Directions:
1. One person opts to be the "dolphin". They leave the room and cover their ears to avoid hearing what comes next.
2. Everyone remaining is an audience of trainers. They must agree on an action that they want the dolphin to do. It must be an action that the dolphin would be able to do easily and that they would enjoy doing - like "do a jumping jack" or "move the chair to the wall".
3. The trainers call the dolphin back into the room.
4. The dolphin now tries out possible movements, waiting for feedback from the trainers. When a trainer feels like the dolphin is approaching the target movement, they say "Ding".
5. The trainers use their "Ding"s wisely to guide the dolphin to the target. Hopefully the dolphin eventually finds the target, and everyone exclaims in joy! 

Notes:

You could add a time limit to each training round. That would be helpful in a group of people that may be more intimidated by being on stage for a long period of time, as it can be a bit disheartening to be a dolphin that can't find its target.

Make sure to specify that the dolphin can use the objects in the environment, as improv'ers are used to ignoring the real objects in the environment.
