Directions:
1. Four people go up on stage. Three of them go offstage where they can't hear, one stays on stage (Person A).
2. Person A asks the audience or improv leader for the location, occupation, and weapon of a murder. They do not need to be related, unless you're trying to make it easier.
3. Once they've decided the three aspects, everyone cheers to indicate that an offstage person should come onstage (Person B).
4. Person A's job is to convey the three parts to Person B, one part at a time. Person A starts by acting out the location. When Person B thinks they understand it, they can thumbs up or act it out as well.
5. Person A then acts out the occupation to Person B, until it seems like Person B understands it.
6. Person A then acts out the weapon to Person B. Once Person B thinks they understand what it is, they take it and pretend to kill Person A with the weapon.
7. Then Person B does steps 4-6 to Person C, and Person C does them to Person D.
8. The four players stand on stage, lined up from D to A. The audience or improv leader asks them each what they think the murder was. D starts with "it was in X, by a Y, with a Z". The audience claps at the parts they got right. Keep asking until you get to a person that got each one right.

Variants:
You can make it harder by adding the constraint that Person A must act as if Person B *has* the occupation, versus acting out the occupation in any way - i.e. Person B is the murdered, and Person A is just acting according to the facts.
