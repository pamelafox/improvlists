An interesting way to create a variety of scenes. 

Directions:
1. One person starts off on stage. If you have more than 6 people, then the rest of the people sit as an audience, and the 6 people wait off stage.
2. The first person starts by telling a true story from their life, like a childhood memory or embarrassing story.
3. Once they've told a good amount of that story, a player jumps in from off stage and create a scene. Their first line should gift a lot of information about the scene, so that the story teller knows how to act and respond.
4. The 2 players act out their 2-person scene for a minute or so.
5. Then a 3rd player jumps in from off stage and creates a completely different 3-person scene. They act out that scene for a minute or so.
6. The scene creation continues for however many players you have - up to 6.
7. Once they've acted out the largest scene for a minute, the player that joined most recently will leave the stage. They will then snap into acting out the previous scene, leading it to a conclusion.
8. That continues until the original story teller is standing alone on the stage. They finish their story.

Notes:

The first scene might be related to the story. However, subsequent scenes shouldn't be that related, because that makes it hard for audience members to realize they're watching an entirely different scene.

It's hard to create a 4/5/6 person scene that isn't just pure chaos. It's helpful to have audience members watching who can comment on what it was like to watch the scenes, to help improve the group scenes.
