A classic improv game. Great for introducing newbies to Yes-Anding in mini scenes.

Directions:
1. One player goes up on "stage". They form a pose like a tree and declare "I am a tree!"
2. Another player joins them on stage. They add onto the scene somehow, creating a pose and declaring what they are. For example, they might wave their hands and declare "I am the wind blowing the leaves!"
3. A third player joins them on stage, and also add onto the scene. For example, they might puff their cheeks up and declare "I am Zeus, blowing the wind out!"
4. Now the original player must go off stage, and take one other player with them. They declare who they're taking away, like "I'll take the wind" and both move off stage.
5. The remaining player re-declares what they are, but now they are without the context of the two other players. For example, they'll say "I am Zeus!".
6. Now another player joins them on stage, and the game repeats.

Variations:
* If you want to make sure everyone is participating, you can line all the players up, and you always join the stage next if you're next in line.
* You can play a more rapid-fire version of this in smaller groups, in groups of 4, 3, or even 2! That's a bit more intense, so it's better for slightly more experienced players.
