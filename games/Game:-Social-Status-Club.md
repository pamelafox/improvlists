This is a series of scene games that experiment with the idea of status. "Status" can be interpreted multiple ways, and is often conflated 1-to-1 with class hierarchy in society. However, in improv and particularly in these games, we are focusing on bodily status - the way in which our bodies take up space in the surroundings. Encourage each other to distinguish bodily status from society status.

Directions:
* Split the group in half, and have them stand in 2 lines facing each other.
* Explain that they will all be in a scene where they're attending the first meeting of a social club. Decide on what the social club will be about (socks, fly fishing, knitting, etc).

Round 1:
* Assign one group to start as High status and one group to start as Low status.
* For the first round, status will be all about eye contact. Demonstrate High status eye contact: making eye contact and holding it. Demonstrate Low status eye contact: averting eye contact, only looking up quickly from time to time, quickly looking behind you to make sure everything's okay. Both of the groups have positive worldview behind the way they present themselves: High status people think that the world is a better place if everyone shares eye contact generously, Low status people think that the world works better when people don't impose their eye contact on each other.
* Ask everyone to randomly walk around to mix things up, and then begin the scene.
* After they mingle for 3 minutes, stop the scene.
* Discuss what it felt like to evoke high and low status.

Round 2:
* For this round, they will be going to a later meeting of the social club, after a few events have happened. They might want to talk about those events and see what they thought of them.
* Switch the groups, so whoever was Low is now High, and vice versa.
* For the second round, status is also about body position. Demonstrate High status body position: wide open arms, a confident stance. Demonstrate Low status body position: shoulders hunched, 1 or both arms crossed, feet bowed. 
* Ask everyone to randomly walk around to mix things up, and then begin the scene.
* After they mingle for 3 minutes, stop the scene.
* Discuss what it felt like to evoke high and low status.

Round 3:
* For this round, they will be going to a meeting a year later of the social club. The club is a lot bigger now, and there are board elections coming up.
* Switch the groups, so whoever was Low is now High, and vice versa.
* For this round, status is also about physical touch. High status people are very comfortable giving touch and being near to people - they think it's great to increase intimacy. Low status people aren't comfortable receiving touch and being so close - they think it's inappropriate.
* Ask everyone to randomly walk around to mix things up, and then begin the scene.
* After they mingle for 3 minutes, stop the scene.
* Discuss what it felt like to evoke high and low status.

Round 4:
* For this round, they will be going to a meeting 2 years later of the social club. The club is now a global phenomenon and is about to have a huge announcement.
* This time, you'll give playing cards or post-its to each person, and ask them to place it on their forehead without looking. If using cards, pick a range and make sure there are duplicates and missing numbers, so that people can't deduce by card counting. The card will indicate their status (from Low to High), and they will not know their status. They will try to determine it based on how people interact with them, and evoke it appropriately.
* Ask everyone to randomly walk around to mix things up, and then begin the scene.
* After they mingle for 3 minutes, stop the scene.
* Ask them to line themselves up according to what status they think they have.
* Allow everyone to look at their card.
* Discuss!
