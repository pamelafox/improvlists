This game creates a fun dialogue and involves both status and the principle of Jump-and-Justify.

Directions:
* Play either in pairs or with an audience watching a pair.
* Decide which person will start as the master and which person will start as the servant.
* The master begins with "Jeeves, I brought you here to talk about something..."
* The servant replies, "Oh, is it about the X?" where X is some object of the master's, like "your fine china" or "your dog.
* The master responds, "My X??" and then adds an additional detail, like "My dog?? The one that's the fluffiest in all the land??" and then finishes with "What happened??" (This isn't what the master wanted to talk about, so he's surprised that the servant thinks thats what its about)
* The servant replies with a single sentence of what's happened to X, like "Well, sir, he's completely hairless now." This is the "Jump".
* The master responds, "How did that happen??"
* Now the servant must come up with some explanation, which they hopefully hadn't pre-thought. The explanation will be a much longer story of how exactly the horrible thing happened. This is the "Justify".
* The master responds with appropriate emotion and then says "But actually, that's not what I wanted to talk to you about."
* Now the pair can continue with a new X, or they can switch master/servant.

Notes:
Some people will want to come up with the story of what happened before just coming out and saying it, but that misses the point of this game, so really try to enforce the template of Jump-then-Justify.
