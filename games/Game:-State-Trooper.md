A guessing game where one player must guess the reason that their car was speeding.

Directions:
1. Three players go on stage. One player is the State Trooper, one player is the driver of a car, the other player is their passenger. 
2. The state trooper starts by pulling their "car" over, and asking the driver to step out. The passenger then leave s and goes somewhere where they can't hear the dialogue.
3. The trooper asks the driver a series of questions about their backstory: why were they speeding? where were they going? how do they know each other?
4. Once the trooper thinks they have enough details, they ask the passenger to come back for questioning.
5. Now the positioning is important: the trooper faces the passenger, and passenger can see the car driver over the trooper's shoulder, about 4 feet away.
6. The trooper asks the passenger the same questions. The passenger's goal is to try to come up with the same answers, and they do that by talking while watching the car driver for clues. The car driver is silently making motions and gestures to give the passenger clues (like miming out an object or just crossing their arms to indicate "no" to a story).
7. The trooper continues grilling the passenger until they figure out most of it, or until they've had a good run.
8. Now the game is over, and the car driver can reveal their actual story.

Notes: The audience can give suggestions for the backstory, or the car driver can make it up on the spot.
