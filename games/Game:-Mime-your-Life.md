A quick warm-up game, doubles as a way to find out what's happening in people's lives. 

Directions:
1. Everyone stand in a circle.
2. The first player starts by miming an activity they did that week. Everyone tries to guess what it is.
3. That continues around the circle.

Variations: you can have people mime what they did in the past weekend (great for Mondays) or mime what they plan to do in the coming weekend (great for Fridays).
