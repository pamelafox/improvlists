Directions:
1. One player goes up on stage, and they will be the speaker. Three other players go up on stage behind them, and they will be the slides.
2. The audience gives the speaker a suggestion for their talk title and their name.
3. If there's a host, they now formally introduce the speaker and everyone claps.
4. The speaker starts giving their talk, making it up on the spot.
4. Behind the speaker, the slides-players quickly arrange themselves into a "slide" - they can look like an abstract shape or like a frozen scene, and they don't need to resemble anything the speaker's talking about.
5. At some point, the speaker will say something like "And bla bla bla, as you can see in this slide..." and then turn around to point at their slide.
6. The speaker must very quickly observe the slide, and figure out how to justify the slide, relating it to what they just claimed the slide would be about. (This is often the most humorous moment)
7. Once the speaker is done talking about the slide, they turn away from the slide and say "Next slide". That cues the slides-players to arrange themselves into a new shape/scene.
8. The speaker ends their talk at some point, often ending with something like "This final slide shows what this will mean for the world", something very aspirational.
9. Speakers and slides take a bow. Well done!
