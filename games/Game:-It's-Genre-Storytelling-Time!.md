Directions:
1. Three people go on stage. The stage should have either one chair or three chairs.
2. They ask the audience for three genre suggestions (like "romance", "western", and "ghost story"). 
3. Each person picks what genre they'll be telling a story about.
4. One person starts as the storyteller, sitting down. They tell the first part of the story for their genre, while everyone listens.
5. Once they're done storytelling, the other two act out what they've described, and they might embellish or take it further.
6. Then the next person tells first part of the story for their genre - a completely unrelated story. Once done telling, the other two will act it out.
7. Then the final person tells first part of the story for their genre - once again, a completely unrelated story. Once done telling, the other two will act it out.  
8. Now they start from the first genre, and each person will tell the middle part of the story and watch it get acted out.
9. Finally each person will tell the final part of the story and watch it get acted out.

Notes: A leader can make this a more rapid game by putting a time limit on the storytelling and acting.
