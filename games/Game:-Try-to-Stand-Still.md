This is a short but fascinating group game.

Instructions:
1. Everyone stand in a circle.
2. The first person starts by pointing at someone approximately across the circle from them, and keeps pointing.
3. The pointed-at person now points at someone else across the circle from them, and keeps pointing.
4. Continue until everyone is pointing at someone. The last person will point at the first person.
5. Now everyone can drop their hands, but continue looking at the person they pointed at.
6. Nobody should be making eye contact with anyone, since nobody was pointing at each other.
7. Take a moment for everyone to "get their wiggles out".
8. (Count down from 3) Now everyone tries to stand still. However, each person must mimic the movement of the person they're staring at.
9. Continue playing, end at your choosing.

Notes: 
People might try to make funny movements the first time. Funny things will probably happen regardless, so try to get people to truly stand still. It's short, so you can easily play a few times and see what happens.
