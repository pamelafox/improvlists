Directions:
1. Everyone split into pairs and sit in different parts of the room (ideally in pairs-of-chairs).
2. The person on the left will start as the Host, and the person on the right will be the Guest.
3. The Host starts talking by welcoming their guest to an imaginary TV show, and gifting them with some details about who they are and why they're on the show ("So happy to have you on our show, I've been hearing great things about your new documentary about socks").
4. The Guest then replies, taking in the information they've been gifted and building on it.
5. The conversation continues in a freeform manner until a leader calls "Scene"/blows a whistle.
6. The Host stays in place while the Guest rotates to the next set of chairs.
7. In the next round, the one on the left is the Guest and the one on the right is the Host.
8. Continue playing until everyone has rotated around all the seats, or until you see fit to end it.
