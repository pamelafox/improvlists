Directions:
1. Four people go up on stage, and split into pairs. One person in the audience is their director.
2. Each pair gets a suggestion from the audience for a setting of their scene. 
3. The first pair starts acting out a scene, inspired by the setting suggestion. 
4. At any point, the director can pause them (by whistle blowing or yelling 'scene'). The director then repeats the last line from their scene and directs the second pair to start acting.
5. The second pair starts acting, and their *very first line* is the last line from the first pair's scene. Their setting is different however, so the scene should be an entirely unrelated scene.
6. The director pauses them at some point and repeats their last line to the first pair, who will start acting again, starting on *exactly* that very first line.
7. The director continues alternating between pairs, who always start off with the last line from the other pair, until the scenes reach a good ending point.

Note: Players will be very tempted to try to say something before the first line, but keep urging them to start with exactly that line. This is a good example of "Jump and Justify".
