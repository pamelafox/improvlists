A warmup game for the face.

Directions:
1. Everyone stands or sits in a circle.
2. The first person turns to their side and makes a face at the person next to them. That person responds by mimicing the facial expression, holding for a few seconds. 
3. The second person now does the same to their neighbor, passing them a new facial expression. 
4. Keep going, at least once around the circle.

Variants:
* Add non-verbal sounds to the expressions (grunts and exclamations and whinnys and all that)
* Turn it into a whole group mirroring- one person makes the face, everyone in the circle copies at same time.
