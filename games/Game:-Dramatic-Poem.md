It's good to ramp up to this game by first going through [Setup and Payoff](https://github.com/pamelafox/improvlists/wiki/Game:-Setup-and-Payoff).

Directions:
1. Four players go up on stage.
2. The players ask the audience for a single word suggestion - for example, "sunshine".
3. The players all turn around.
4. One at a time, a player will turn around and recite a line of a poem that ends with a word related to the suggestion. For example: "I used all my green thumb powers to bring forth beautiful flowers". They end on a dramatic pose that they freeze in.
5. The final fourth person comes u with a rhyme that ends with the original suggestion. For example: "All these rays will be mine, when I'm basking in the sunshine". The other 3 players join on saying the final word together.

Notes:
It's important for the final player to time their line so that the 3 players know exactly when the final word is coming up. It's also important for there to be very little time between each line, as that gives the audience a chance to disengage.
