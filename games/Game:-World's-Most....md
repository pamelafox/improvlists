A 2-line scene game, involving gifting and space object work.

Directions:
1. Everyone lines up in two columns, leading up to the stage.
2. The leader announces which line will start off the scenes for this round. 
2. The player at the front of each line goes on stage, so there are two players on stage. 
3. The first player begins by exclaiming "You're the world's..." and then a superlative and noun, like "You're the world's most compassionate pirate!"
4. The second player responds by saying "That's why I have this..." and then some object, like "That's why I have these poor sick parrots on my shoulders!" As they describe the object, they also mime it out as if it's really there.
5. Everyone claps, and the players go to the ends of the lines.
6. Continue until each player in line 1 has started, and then make line 2 be the starters.
7. If you go for a few rounds, mix up the lines so that players get to interact in different pairs.
