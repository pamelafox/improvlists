Directions:
1. 5 players go on stage. 2 players sit in chairs facing the audience, they will be ones telling the audience about their trip. 3 players stand behind the chairs, they will become the photos from the trip.
2. The trip-goers ask the audience for a suggestion of where they went to, and what their relationship is.
4. The trip-goers start talking about their trip, while the 3 players behind them quickly assemble themselves into a photo. At some point, a trip-goer will say reference the upcoming photo, allude to what it's about, and *then* actually look at the "photo".
5. The trip-goer must now justify the photo in terms of what they said it's about and what it physically looks like. This is hard for the improviser, funny for the audience.
6. When they're done talking about the photo, they turn back to the audience and that's the cue for the players to assemble a new photo.
7. The game continues until they trip-goers reach their final photo. Applause!
