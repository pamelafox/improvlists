A fun endowment game.

Directions:
1. Three players go on stage (the performers), three players sit in chairs angled along the side (the judges).
2. The performers begin with the *end* of their performance, by joining hands and saying "thank you" to the judges and audience.
3. The judges then give their judgment of the performance they've just "seen", gifting the performers with details to inspire them.
4. Once all judges have given their judgment, the players go off stage, go back in time, and give their performance. They figure it all out on the spot, without any discussion.
5. The players end with the same thank you they started with.
6. Continue playing until everyone's had a turn.
