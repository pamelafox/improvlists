A fun physical warmup game.

Directions:
1. One person is the MC. They instruct everyone to start milling around in the space.
2. The MC instructs them: "When I say Watermelon, you're going to stop in front of someone near you and touch your elbows together" and then yells "Watermelon!"
3. The MC waits for them to be touching elbows for a sufficiently awkward length of time and then instructs "Start walking!"
4. The MC instructs them again, this time with a different fruit and body part. For example: apple and pinkies, strawberry and palms, banana and shoulders, grapes and feet. 
5. After a few fruits, the MC can instruct them to come up with a unique way to be touching the other person (appropriately, consensually). Typically ends up some sort of funny hand gesture.
6. As a fun challenge, the MC can start yelling out fruit combinations, like "Strawberry Banana". It surprisingly works for a small enough group. They can even yell out "Fruit Salad" to see if every combination can happen at once.
