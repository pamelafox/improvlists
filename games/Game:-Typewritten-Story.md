A storytelling game, a few sentences at a time. Typically followed up by Typewritten Movie.

1. Three people go on stage and sit in three chairs. The person in the chair has the typewriter first. Someone off stage has a whistle or other sound-making device.
2. The typer starts off (miming) typing and telling a story aloud. 
3. At some point (ideally mid-sentence), the sound-maker makes a sound. The typer stops.
4. The next person starts typing and continuing the story from where the last person left off.
5. This continues until the story reaches a logical ending or the sound-maker decides to call it.

Notes:
The audience can suggest a title for the story before they begin.
Try to steer towards more action in the stories, and less dialogue or intellectual explanations. The audience wants action!
