Directions:
1. Everyone stands up, ready to play.
2. One person yells out "Let's..." followed by something to do, like "Let's ride roller coasters!" or "Let's crawl like warms!".
3. Everyone immediately replies "Yes, Let's!" and creates the described activity without discussion, adapting as they see how each other player interprets the directive. 
4. At any point, anyone can yell out another "Let's..." directive, and the game continues.

Note: Each directive typically lasts around ~10 seconds.

This is similar to [Goddess of Creation](https://github.com/pamelafox/improvlists/wiki/Game:-Goddess-of-Creation,-Make-me-a...)
