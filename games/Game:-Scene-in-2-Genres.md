This game can turn an ordinary scene into something extraordinary...

Directions:
1. Two people go up on stage.
2. They ask the audience for some CROW (character/relationship/objective/where), enough for them to start a scene.
3. They act out that scene, bringing it to a conclusion. 
4. Now two other people go up on stage.
5. They ask the audience for a genre suggestion (e.g. horror movie, film noir, romcom, space opera, etc).
6. They then act out the same scene, but in that genre.
