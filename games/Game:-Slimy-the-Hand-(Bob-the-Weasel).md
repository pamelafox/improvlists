Actually more of a summer camp game than an improv game, but hey, what's the difference?

To play this game, you will need some small object. We used a tiny fake hand (Slimy), but you could also use a beanie baby, stuffed animal, or whatever else you find.

Directions:
1. Everyone stands in a circle, one person goes into the center.
2. Everyone else gets closer in the circle until there is no space left between people. (This can be awkward for groups smaller than 8).
3. One person starts with the object, and passes it around behind their backs. While the circled people are passing it around, they chant "Slimy the hand, keep it going keep it going".
4. It's the job of the center person to find the person who currently has the object behind their back. If they suspect someone has it, they can point at them and that person has to show both their hands in front of their body.
5. The circled people can tease the center person by quickly showing the object (like when the center person is looking in a different direction). Then everyone who sees it chants "I saw the Hand, I saw the Hand!".
6. Once the centered person successfully finds someone with the object, they switch places and the game continues.
