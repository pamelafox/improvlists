Good practice in visualizing a completely made up place, filled with space objects.

Directions:
1. Everyone lines up to the side of the stage. They decide what setting they'll create, like "playground" or "pub".
2. The first player goes up and describes some object that's in the space, clearly showing where it is.
3. The next player goes up and describes another object, making sure to respect the other objects already in the space (walking around them as needed).
4. One by one, all the players go up and place objects in the scene.
5. Optional: When the place is created, you can create a scene in that place.
