This warm-up game is designed to be difficult, so it's a great way to practice failure. It also requires very focused attention.

There are 3 versions of this game, which ramp up in difficulty. Demonstrate each variant before playing. 

Version #1: Poses
* Everyone picks a partner to play with.
* Person A makes a pose. Person B observes and remembers the pose, but does nothing in response.
* Person A makes a second pose. Now Person B makes the first pose.
* Person A makes a third pose. Now Person B makes the second pose.
* Continue the cycle!
* Switch who starts after playing for a few minutes.

Version #2: Stories
* Everyone picks a new partner to play with.
* This time, you'll be telling a story, one word at a time, starting with "Once Upon a Time".
* Person A says "Once". Person B remembers the word.
* Person A says "Upon". Now Person B says "Once".
* Person A says "A". Now Person B says "Upon".
* Continue the cycle!
* Switch who starts after playing for a few minutes.

Version #3: Stories & Poses!
* Everyone picks a new partner to play with.
* This time, one of you will be starting the story, and the other will be starting the poses. Note that this is very difficult, both to explain and to play.
* Person A says "Once". Person B remembers the word, then makes the first pose.
* Person B says "Upon". Person B says "Once", then makes a second pose.
* Person B says "A", and makes the first pose. Person B says "Upon", then makes a third pose.
* Person B says "Time", and makes the second pose. Person B says "A", then makes a fourth pose.
* Continue the cycle!
* Switch who starts after playing for a few minutes.
