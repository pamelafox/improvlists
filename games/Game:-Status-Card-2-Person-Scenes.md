A way to generate short scenes and experiment with status. You'll need a deck of playing cards or some way of giving the players status numbers.

Directions:
1. Two people go on stage. Everyone else is in the audience.
2. Each of the players randomly pick a card from the card deck. They do NOT reveal it to each other. The cards convey their status, from low (A) to high (K).
3. The audience gifts the players with some bits of CROW (character/relationship/objective/whereabouts).
4. The players start acting in their scene, attempting to maintain their status while discovering the status of the other person and adjusting accordingly.
5. The scene will reach some logical conclusion, everyone claps!
6. The audience tries to guess the status cards for each person, and then they reveal their cards.

Variants:
One person can be in charge of giving the cards to the players, and they could specifically choose the cards. That works well in an improv classroom situation where the teacher has more specific schools.
