A low-pressure way to create tiny scenes, with gifting all around.

Directions:
1. Everyone stands in a circle.
2. One player goes in the middle and poses in some way. For example, lifting their arms to the sky with a stricken look on their face.
3. Another player joins them, and creates a pose that complements theirs in some way. For example, kneeling before them, staring at their hands. They then come up with a line of dialogue. For example, "Forgive me sir, for I have eaten all the plums!"
4. The first player responds with a line of dialogue. For example, "But those plums were for the holy plum-throwing ceremony!"
4. Any player in the circle comes up with a title for the scene. For example, "The Emperor Eats No Plums"
5. Everyone claps, and the players re-join the circle.
6. A new player enters the circle, makes a pose, and the game continues.
