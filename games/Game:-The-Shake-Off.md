A great way to start off an improv session and get everyone loosened up.

Directions:
1. Everyone stands in a circle.
2. A leader will give instructions: "We'll yell 5-4-3-2-1 while shaking out our limbs. First our right arm, then our left, then our right leg, then our left, then our whole body. Then we'll yell 4-3-2-1 and shake them, 3-2-1, 2-1, etc. Your goal during that time is to make contact with each person in the circle at least once."
3. The leader starts yelling and shaking out the right arm (by shooting it high into the air). Everyone joins in.
4. That continues until everyone ends on "1", shaking out each limb once.
5. At the end, the leader can ask if everyone found each other's eyes. It can be fun to see if some people were chasing each other.

Variants:
* If you're worried about volume, you can whisper-yell instead of yell-yell.
* At the end, you could put all your hands in the middle and then bring them up, yelling "Crrrrrazy Eights!"
