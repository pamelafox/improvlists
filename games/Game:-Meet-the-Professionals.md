Directions:
1. Three players go on stage in chairs. They ask the audience for a suggestion of a profession. A leader can also introduce with "Welcome to our panel of professionals! They'll answer all your questions about this profession, so that you can decide whether to pursue it. Now, what profession do you want them to have?"
2. The players now assume the profession and introduce themselves, endowing themselves with a name and backstory.
3. The leaders asks them questions, or the audience asks questions.
4. Continue until you've had your fill of that panel, and invite 3 new players on stage with a new profession.
