This game is a great way to practice giving and receiving gifts, and works well as a precursor to other games. 

There are 3 versions which ramp up in gift-y ness. Demonstrate each in a pair first.

Version #1:
1. Everyone picks a partner.
2. Person A gives Person B a gift, and says what it is, for example, "I got you this golden hula hoop!"
3. Person B profusely thanks Person A and puts the gift away.
4. Person B now gives Person A a gift, and says what it is.
5. Person A profusely thanks Person B and puts the gift away.
6. Repeat for a few minutes, switch who starts halfway through.

Version #2:
1. Everyone picks a new partner.
2. Person A gives Person B a gift, miming a space object but not saying what it is. For example, "Oh, here, I've got you this gift!"
3. Person B acknowledges what the gift is (making it up). For example, "Oh wow, thank you, a pet bunny rabbit!"
4. Person B now gives Person A a gift, once again not saying what it is.
5. Person A acknowledges the gift and puts it away.
6. Repeat for a few minutes, switch who starts halfway through.

Version #3:
1. Everyone picks a new partner.
2. Like Version #2: Person A gives Person B a gift, miming a space object but not saying what it is. For example, "Oh, here, I've got you this gift!"
3. Like Version #2: Person B acknowledges what the gift is (making it up). For example, "Oh wow, thank you, a pet bunny rabbit!"
4. Here's the variation: Person A now adds on an additional physical detail, like "Yes, and it's rainbow colored just like your bedroom!"
5. Person B now gives the gift, following that structure.
6. Repeat for a few minutes, switch who starts halfway through.

Notes:
If you only have time for one variant, #2 is the most common.
