A fun warmup game with some rhythm and physicality.

Directions:
1. Everyone stand in a circle.
2. One person starts walking around the middle of the circle.
3. As they walk, everyone sings "Lil Sally* Walker, walking down the street, didn't know what to do, so she stopped in front of me and said..." _Except_ they don't actually say "Sally", they sing that person's name ending with an "-y" sound, like "tommy", "pammy", etc. 
3. Once the walking person hears "stopped in front of me", they stop in front of someone in the circle and start dancing, however they'd like. Everyone continues singing "hey now, do that thing, do that thing, do that thing".
4. Now everyone else joins in dancing like the walker, and they continue one more verse of "hey now, do that thing, do that thing, do that thing".
5. Finally they finish with "AND STOP!" and everyone stops dancing. The walker trades places with whoever they stopped in front of, and that person now begins as the walker.
6. This continues until everyone's walked at least once.

Full song:

* Little Sally* Walker,
* walking down the street
* Didn't know what to do,
* so she stopped in front of me
* and said,
* 'Hey now, do that thing, do that thing, do that thing'
* 'Hey now, do that thing, do that thing, and stop!'
