A good exercise to practice sharing the stage in group scenes.

Directions:
1. Four people go on stage and line up from left to right.
2. Person 1 will say the first line in a scene. Once they've said their line, they cannot speak a line again until Person 4 has gone. They can make facial expressions and sounds, however.
3. Person 2 then says the second line in the scene, then Person 3 says the third, and Person 4 says the fourth.
4. They continue saying one line at a time until the director ends the scene. 
5. The next scene is started by whoever was next in line to speak when the scene ended. Ideally, the director cuts the scenes to allow each of the players a chance at starting a scene.
6. The scenes continue until you've had your fill.

Note: The players can ask the audience for a one-word suggestion to inspire their scene, or they can make it up entirely on their own. The latter is faster and a bit better practice in scene generation.

Variant: After a few rounds of dialogue, you can start to add restrictions. The first restriction is that they can only use 2 words each. The next restriction is that they can only use gibberish. The final restriction is that they can't use any words (and must simply alternate capturing the audience's focus).
