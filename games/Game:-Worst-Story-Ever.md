The goal of this game is to tell an entire story. We call it "Worst Story Ever" so that players don't feel the pressure of telling a good story - the goal is to tell any story at all.

Directions:
1. One player goes up on stage, they'll be the storyteller.
2. The storyteller asks the audience for suggestion(s) of setting, character, or objects.
3. The storyteller then makes up an entire story based on the suggestion, starting with "Once upon a time.." and finishing with "The End".
4. The audience cheers!
