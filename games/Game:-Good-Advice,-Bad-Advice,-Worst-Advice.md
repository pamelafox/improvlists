Directions:
1. 3 players go on stage and sit in a row of 3 chairs.
2. For the first round, player 1 will give good advice, player 2 will give bad advice, and player 3 will give worst advice (starting from the audience's left).
3. Player 1 asks the audience for a question that they'd like advice on. It's best if the audience members ask a real question, or at least a realistic non-ridiculous question, as the players will bring the ridiculousness later.
4. Player 1 thanks them for the question and starts giving good wholesome advice.
5. Player 2 gives them bad advice.
6. Player 3 gives them the worst advice (this is where things can go dark, but it *is* possible to give bad advice that isn't violent, and often better).
7. Player 2 now asks the audience for another question. This time, they give good advice, player 3 gives bad advice, and player 1 gives the worst advice.
8. For the final round, player 3 asks the audience for the third question. This time, player 3 gives good advice, player 1 gives bad advice, and player 2 gives the worst advice.

Notes: It's fun to get into the idea that the 3 players are on a radio show, as you can say things like "Yes caller, thanks for calling in". The players can also banter with each other ("My colleague is very esteemed but wayyy off").
