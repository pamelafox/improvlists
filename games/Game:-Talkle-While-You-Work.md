Directions:
1. Two people go up on stage.
2. They get a suggestion from the audience or the leader of something they're physically doing (e.g. taking photos, stacking books, laying bricks), and an unrelated topic of conversation.
3. They start acting out what they're doing and talking about the topic, and *never* mentioning the thing they're doing. 
4. This continues until they or the leader ends the scene.

Round 2:

Same as before, but the players must know each other's names after the first 2 lines of dialogue.

Round 3:

Same as before, but now the players try to use each other's names in *every* line of dialogue.

Round 4:

This time, the players don't get a topic of conversation, because the only words they can say are each other's names, and they should say them a lot. It's helpful here for the players to tune into how their characters are feeling, to see how that affects their response.
