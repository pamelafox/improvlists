A warmup game, recommended anytime there are new faces in a group.

Directions:
1. Everyone stands in a circle.
2. The leader introduces the game: "We're all going to go around and say our name and then make a motion. Then everyone repeats our name and motion as us. I'll start!"
3. The leader makes the name and motion, then everyone echos it back to them.
4. Continue in the circle until you get back to the leader.
5. Then the leader says "Ok, now let's try to repeat those one more time. This time, we say each name and motion once, together."
6. Then everyone goes round in a circle yelling names and making motions.

Variant:
You can add a third round where each person needs to say their adjective before their name (bonus points for alliteration!) and then a motion that's probably related to the adjective.
