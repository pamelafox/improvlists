Directions:
1. If anyone in your group is musically inclined, ask them to be the band for this game. They can use guitars, drums, shakers, etc. Everyone else circles around the band.
2. One person goes on "stage" (or just in the center). They will be the singer.
3. The singer asks the group for a song and/or genre suggestion, and then asks the band to start playing them backing music.
4. The singer starts singing a song, completely improvised. Anyone in the group can join in with backup vocals to support them.
5. The singer continues singing until they mention sex, death, or food, or if they make it, until they end their song.
6. Then someone else becomes the singer. Continue at least until everyone has had a chance to sing.
