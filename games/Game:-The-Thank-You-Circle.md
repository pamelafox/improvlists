A newbie-friendly game with an emphasis on collaboration and body creativity - no words!

Directions:
1. Everyone stands in a circle.
2. One player goes into the middle of the circle and makes a pose with their body.
3. Another player (anyone) joins them in the middle, and adds onto the pose. No words are exchanged.
4. The original player says "Thank you" and leaves the middle. The second player remains posed.
5. Another player joins, and the game repeats.

This game can be a lead-in to "Name that 2-line scene" or "Modern Art Gallery".
