In this game, one person is the the star of a scene but also a willing puppet. 
Directions:
1. One person opts to be on stage as the pupper. Everyone else is the audience.
2. The puppers asks "What comes first?"
3. Someone in the audience describes what happens, like "You find yourself in a dark cave."
4. The puppet acts out that line. When they feel they've acted it fully, they ask "What comes next?"
5. Once again, someone in the audience describes what happens next, like "You hear a strange noise behind you."
6. The scene continues like that until it reaches some conclusion.
