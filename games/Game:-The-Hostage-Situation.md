Directions:
1. One person volunteers to be the hostage-taker, leaves the room and covers their ears.
2. Two people volunteer to be the hostages.
3. Together with the audience, they decide 1) where they're being held hostage, and 2) what their hostage-taker's demand is. For example, they might be in the International Space Station, and the taker's demand is to bring back purple ketchup.
4. They call the hostage-taker back to the stage.
5. The hostages and hostage-taker now communicate back and forth with each other, staying in character with the scene. The hostage-taker's goal is to discover the secret information, and the hostages will try to slowly reveal it in conversation. 
6. The audience can clap when they hear the hostage-taker state a correct bit of information.
7. When enough time has gone by or it seems like the hostage-taker knows the information, the leader can end the scene and ask them where they think they are, and what they think the demand is.
