Nice way to start up an improv sesh.

Directions:
1. Everyone stand in a circle.
2. One person starts stretching (or "stretching") however they'd like, while sharing something from their day or week. Everyone else copies their movement.
3. Go around the circle until everyone's had a chance to stretch & share.
