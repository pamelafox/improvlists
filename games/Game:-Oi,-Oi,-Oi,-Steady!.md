A super fun pass-style warmup game. Best played with a cowboy accent.

Directions:
1. Everyone stands in a circle.
2. The first person turns to their side and makes a passing motion to the next person, yelling "Oi!" as they do that.
3. That person then turns to their side and passes "Oi!" to the next person. (Note: there is no receiving like in Pass The Clap, only passing.)
4. Once everyone has "Oi'd" once, you can start experimenting with blocking. If someone wants to block an "Oi!" they wave their hands in front of their face and yell "Steaddddddy!". That means the passer must turn to their other side and pass the "Oi" the other way.
5. After a round of that, you can start passing across the circle. To do that, point at someone and yell "Take it!" They can either point at someone else to "Take it!", pass an "Oi" to either side, or they can block by crossing their arms in front and exclaiming "Hold your horses!".
6. Continue to your heart's delight. :)
