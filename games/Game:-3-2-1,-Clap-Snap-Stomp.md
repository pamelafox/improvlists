A surprisingly difficult coordination game. Good for focusing or for failing! :) 

Directions:
1. Everyone breaks off into pairs of players.
2. In the first round, each pair starts off by alternating saying "3", "2", "1".
3. In the second round, instead of saying "3", the current player must clap their hands together.
4. In the third round, instead of saying "2", the current player must snap their fingers.
5. In the fourth round, instead of saying "1", the current player must stomp their feet.

Variation: You can have the pair decide what they want to do as their motion in the third round, to give them a little creative control.
