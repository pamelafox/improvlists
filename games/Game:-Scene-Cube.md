A game to practice rapid switching between different characters/scenes.

Directions:
1. Four players go on stage and arrange themselves in a cube (two in front, two in back).
2. The leader or audience gives the front pair of players a setting (like taxi cab). 
3. Then the cube rotates so that a new pair is in front (with one person in common with the previous pair), and they receive a setting suggestion.
4. The cube keeps rotating until all pairs have a setting suggestion.
5. To make sure they everyone remembers, the cube can rotate through once more and each pair yells their setting.
6. Let the scenes begin! The first pair begins creating a dialogue-based scene. They end when the leader yells "rotate!".
7. The cube keeps rotating through their scenes. When it's time for the second scene for a pair, they can pretend that some time has passed since their first scene, they don't need to pick off exactly where they left off.
8. The leader can yell "reverse rotate" to get the cube to rotate in the other direction.
9. The leader can tell the players when it's the final scene round, and end the game after that round.
 
The leader can even reverse the rotation, to keep them on their toes.
