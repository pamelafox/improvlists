Directions:
1. Two players go up on stage. One player will be the pawn shop owner (the buyer) and the other player will be the seller. 
2. The seller goes offstage into a cone of silence. The owner asks the audience what the player should be selling to them - like Frodo's cape, an Egyptian mummy, Michael Jackson's glove, a broken teapot, etc.
3. The audience cheers the seller to come back on stage. 
4. The seller mimes bringing their object into the shop - perhaps by lugging it or carrying it in a box. 
5. Now the owner and seller engage in a back-and-forth conversation and space object exploration. The seller's goal is to figure out what they're selling while pretending they know what it is, the owner's goal is to subtly reveal it to them during their conversation. For example, the owner might say "How long have you had this? It looks a bit rusty" and that gives the seller a hint. The seller could ask "How much do you think you could sell this for?" and the owner's answer will give them a hint.
6. Once the seller figures it out, they reveal it within the dialogue, and everyone cheers!
