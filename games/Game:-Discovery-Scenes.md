This is a structured scene-creation game, and it works really well after Presents.

Directions:
1. Everyone sits as an audience.
2. Ask 2 people to perform in the scene.
3. Those 2 people are detectives of a crime scene. Ask the audience for suggestions for the crime, and try to avoid violent crime.
4. The 2 people arrive at the crime scene. 
5. Person A will point somewhere and exclaim something like "Wow, look at that!"
6. Person B will acknowledge it and make up what it is, like "Ohhh, wow, it's a pile of counterfeit cash!"
7. Person A will add at least one additional detail, like "Yeah, and each dollar has a signature on it!"
8. Now, Person B will be the one to point somewhere and exclaim.
9. Person A will acknowledge it and make up what it is.
10. Person B will add an additional detail.
11. The 2 people continue alternating like this until the scene feels done.

Notes:
Besides the detective scene, you can also use these scenarios: 1) A couple checking out a potential house to move in to 2) Parents venturing into the room of their rebellious teenager.
