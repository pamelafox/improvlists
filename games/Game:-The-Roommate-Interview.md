Directions:
* On the stage, arrange 3 chairs in a row and one chair on the side, mimicing a couch and a side chair.
* Ask four people to go on stage and arrange themselves in the chairs.
* Assign them a status from 1 to 4. The one in the chair will typically be on the low side.
* In this scene, the 3 on the couch are roommates interviewing the other person. The fourth person will start the scene outside. The goal is for them to interview the potential roommate, while staying true to their status.
* Begin the scene with the fourth person outside knocking.
* End the scene at a logical conclusion.
* Discuss!

Version #2:
* Do the first version first. Then, later, you can have each of the people decide on their status without revealing it. Their goal then becomes to evoke that status in the scene - and if two people pick the highest or lowest status, they may find themselves having to evoke even harder.
