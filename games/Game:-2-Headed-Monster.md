Directions:
1. Two people go up on stage, and get close (either standing right next to each other, or if they're comfortable, arms around each other's shoulders). They're now a 2-headed monster!
2. The audience asks the monster the first question, "What is your name?"
3. The monster people respond by speaking together (often slowly, so they can figure out what words they're forming). It helps if they start off by rephrasing the question, like "My name is ", and then the only unknown word is the last one.
4. The audience continues asking them questions, like about their hometown, hobbies, love life, diet, life goals. They can even ask them to sing a song or do a dance (but they might say no!).
5. The interview ends after ~5 questions, monsters get tired easily.
6. Continue sending more monsters on stage, until everyone's had a chance to be a monster.
7. After the game, reflect on how it felt to speak together, and whether it felt like there was an obvious leader/follower, or an ebb and flow, or just pure synchronicity.
