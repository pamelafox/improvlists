A guessing game where each person must discover their own secret.

Directions:
1. Two players go on stage, one player immediately leaves to somewhere where they can't hear.
2. The audience suggests a secret for the player that left, like "she's just inherited 1 million dollars".
3. Now the player that left comes back on stage, and the first one leaves.
4. The audience suggests a secret for the player that just left, like "she's hoarding dozens of cats."
5. Now both players come back on stage, and sit in chairs. The audience can suggest their relationship to each other, like friend or family or colleagues.
6. The two players begin having a conversation, like they're catching up at a cafe. Their goal is to get their fellow player to guess their secret, by dropping hints. For example, "oh, will you be ordering the tuna? You must really like it, considering..." or "Perhaps we should both order steak, to celebrate your recent news."
7. The conversations continue until they hopefully both figure out the secret, like "Oh, yes, I couldn't hoard all these cats if I didn't like tuna" and "Well, yes, inheriting a million dollars is certainly something to celebrate!" They likely won't get it spot on, but close enough is good enough.
