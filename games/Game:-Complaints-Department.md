Directions:
1. 4 players go on stage. 3 players will be the customers and one will be the clerk.
2. The clerk leaves the room and the audience suggests a fictional store for the three customers to complain about, like "Spheres R Us" or "Swords of Yore".
3. The clerk returns, situates themself, and the customers come up in turn to register complaints about their items. 
Each customer tries to give increasingly more hints about the type of store, while staying in character.
4. When the clerk thinks they know what the store is, they can reveal it in dialogue ("Thank you for shopping at The Ball Emporium!"), and the audience claps if they're right.
