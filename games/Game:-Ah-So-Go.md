A coordination game which forces everyone to pay complete attention.

Directions:
1. Everyone stands in a circle.
2. One person starts by raising their right hand to their brow (like a salute) and saying "Ah".
3. The person to the right of them then raises their left hand to their chest (like a salute at the chest) and says "So".
4. The original person now points his hand towards someone else in the circle and says "Go".
5. The receiving person then begins the cycle again, at "Ah".
