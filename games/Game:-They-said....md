Slow down your dialogues to see how it changes your responses.

Directions:
1. Everyone splits into triples. In each triple, one person is the "judge" that sits in a chair. The other two are standing.

Round 1:

2. The leader gives everyone a word to inspire their scene, and instructs one side to start. 
3. Person A makes up a first line of dialogue.
4. Person B turns to the judge and says "They said" and tries to repeat exactly what Person A said.
5. Person B now turns back to Person A and responds, in character.
6. Now Person A turns to the judge and says "They said" and repeats what Person B said.
7. They continue back and forth until the scene logically ends or the leader ends it.
8. Switch so that the judge gets a chance to be a player.

Round 2:

The same as before, except now each person must say "They said..." followed by "and now I feel...", trying to get in touch with how their character feels in response.

Round 3:

The same as Round 2, but now each pair must establish names and relationship in the first 2 lines of dialogue.

Round 4:

The same as Round 3, but now each line of dialogue begins with "I" or "You".

Round 5:

The same as Round 4, but now each line of dialogue begins with "I want/need" or "You want/need".
