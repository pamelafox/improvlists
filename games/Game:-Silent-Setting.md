A good game to warmup into scene work, with emphasis on space objects and active listening to each other's space object work.

Directions:
1. Everyone splits into pairs OR one pair goes on stage while the rest watch.
2. The leader or the audience suggest a setting for the pair, like "Classroom".
3. The pair starts acting *silently* as if they are in that setting. Their goal is to discover their relationship to each other and to the setting, so it is very much a collaboration.
4. After a period of time (1-2 mins), the leader calls "scene!" and asks each player what they think their relationship was to the other one.

Variants: You can then repeat the same game, but allow gibberish.
