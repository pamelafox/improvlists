This is a way to generate ideas for scenes.

Directions:
1. The players arrange the stage like a living room - 3 chairs like a couch, perhaps another chair on the side, and people just sitting around in front.
2. The players ask the audience for a one word suggestion (like "blueberries").
3. One player starts sharing a story that the word reminds him of, like they'd share with friends while sitting around a living room.
4. Another player shares a story, either related to the word or the last story told.
5. After they've shared 3-5 stories, the players clear the living room and line up on the side of the stage.
6. Now the players are ready to start making up scenes, inspired by the stories shared in the living room.
7. Follow up with a [Scene Montage](https://github.com/pamelafox/improvlists/blob/master/games/Game:-Scene-Montage.md).
