This is a fun embodied storytelling game. 

Directions:
1. Everyone sits as an audience.
2. Ask 2 people to perform in the scene. Those 2 people will describe a scene they're in, one word at a time.
3. Person A says "We".
4. Person B says "Are".
5. Person A says some -ing verb, like "Swimming". 
6. Both people now begin swimming.
7. They continue the scene, one word at a time, always staying in the present tense and acting out everything.
8. At any point, one person can say "Suddenly" and that often causes something exciting to happen.
9. Continue until the scene comes to a logical conclusion.

Notes:
It can also be done in pairs, but it's fun to watch! Sometimes people will be tempted to say "I", but it's better to stick with "We", so that acting is always done together.
