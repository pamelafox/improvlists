A freeform format where the end result is a movie.

Directions:
1. 2-5 players go on stage, and start off in the "wings".
2. The players ask the audience for a genre suggestion (spy, thriller, superhero, romcom, etc). If this is a classroom setting, the players can discuss the general storyline for movies in that genre, to remind themselves of plot elements.
3. The director fades the lights to black, announces "scene 1", and then turns the lights back on.
4. The players start acting out the first scene from the movie, which doesn't need to involve every player.
5. The director decides when to fade the lights to black, signaling the end of the scene, and turn them back on to signal the next scene.
6. The players continue making up scenes in the movie, and the director continues cueing them off and on.
7. If this is a classroom setting, the director can pause the movie at any point, and ask the players to discuss the current state of the movie. Do all the players know the names and relationships of the characters in the scenes? Is it clear to the audience what the motivations of the characters are? Is a crucial plot point missing?
8. The movie continues until it reaches its happy/tragic ending.
