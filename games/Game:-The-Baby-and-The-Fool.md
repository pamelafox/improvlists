This game is designed to release people from their inhibitions, typically played at the beginning of an improv session.

Directions:
1. Leader says "When I say go, all of you will act like babies, whatever that means to you. Go!"
2. Everyone acts like babies :)
3. After a few minutes, leader yells "Scene!" to get everyone out of baby mode.
4. Leader says "When I say go, all of you will act like fools - jokers, jesters, clowns, whatever that means to you. Go!"
5. Everyone acts like fools :)
6. After a few minutes, leader yells "Scene!" to get everyone out of fool mode.
7. Leader asks the group for observations on that experience. Which mode felt more natural? What was a struggle? Did they act differently then normal?

Notes: The "fool" here is inspired by Harlequino in Comedia D'el Arte, and some folks may struggle to act like one, as "fool" is more ambiguous than "baby" to most. Good fodder for discussion after.
