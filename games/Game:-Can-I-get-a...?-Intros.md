Quick and fun warm-up game.

Directions:
1. Everyone stands in a circle.
2. The leader explains: "Each of us will say 'Can I get a...' and make a sound and a motion that indicates either how we're currently feeling or how we want to be feeling. Then everyone responds with 'You can get a...' and copies that sound and motion."
3. The leader starts with their Can-I-get-a.
4. The game continues around the circle until everyone's gotten-a.
