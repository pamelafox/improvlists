A fun warmup game where you'll actually learn a few things about each other.

Directions:
* Sit in a circle of chairs
* Now everyone stand up from their chairs
* One person goes into the center of the circle and says "I have a feeling..."
* Everyone says "ooOOO!" as if they are psychic
* They continue saying "... that somebody here..." and then finish with some attribute that they think is true about at least one person. For example, "I have a feeling that somebody here has visited Europe".
* Each person decides if it is true about themselves. If true, they remain standing. If it's not true, they sit down.
* If it happened that it wasn't true about anyone and everyone is now sitting, they all exclaim "You're no psychic!" and the round is over.
* If it happened that it was true about only one person (i.e. only one person is standing), then the others all exclaim "You're so psychic!" and the round is over.
* Otherwise, if there are still people standing, then the pretend psychic comes up with a new prediction. It's fun if that prediction is a more specific version of the first one, like "I have a feeling that somebody here visited a castle in Europe."
* Keep going until the round ends with either 1 person standing or 0 people standing.
* Play until you've had your fill of the game.

Notes:
You can have people go into the center in a sequence or just popcorn style, whoever "has a feeling".
