A surprisingly difficult game. The debaters are the ones doing the hard improving in this game, as they must both make up coherent debate sentences and guess words at the same time.

Directions:
1. 2 players leave the room.
2. 6 players remain, divided into teams of 3, seated facing.
3. The leader picks a word that each team must get their debater to guess, like "tobacco". They'll figure out how to split that word into 3 syllables, like "toe"-"back"-"oh", and decide which player will mime each syllable.
4. The debaters enter the room.
5. The leader introduces the debaters, announces who goes first, and starts a timer for 30 seconds.
6. The debater starts making up a debate ("my partner is always...") while trying to guess what their team is miming, like "my partner is always TOEing the line". If the debater says the word, their team thumbs up and moves on to the next word.
7. When the leader calls time, the next debater starts. 
8. Each debater continues back and forth. If they figure out all three syllables (i.e. the whole word), they say "my partner is a tobacco!", and then they win.
9. If the leader thinks the game has gone on too long with no winner, they can end it.
