The goal of this game is to put on a mini-movie which shows the stories of multiple groups of characters and shows how they come together in the end.

Directions:
1. 4 people go on stage, and split into 2 pairs. Either the audience or the leader gives them some CROW - who are they, where are they, what are they doing.
2. In Scene 1, pair 1 starts on stage and improvises a scene. The scene ends when they leave the stage, when the leader calls it, or when pair 2 enters the stage.
3. In Scene 2, pair 2 improvises a scene.
4. In Scene 3, pair 1 improvises another scene, later in time from the first.
5. In Scene 4, pair 2 improvises another scene.
6. In Scene 5, all 4 are on stage in a scene that involves all of them and brings the movie to its conclusion.

Notes: You can put a twist on this by forcing the first few scenes to be done silently. That puts more emphasis on action-oriented scenes and full body communication.
