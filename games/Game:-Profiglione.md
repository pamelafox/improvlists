Nearly the same game as [Hep](https://github.com/pamelafox/improvlists/blob/master/games/Game:-Hep!.md).
You can add in the additional rules over time based on how the group is doing.

Directions:

1. Everyone stands in a circle.
1. The first person turns to either side, makes eye contact or mimes a passing motion, and says "Profiglione".
1. That person then turns to either side and passes "Profiglione" to the next person.
1. Once everyone has "Profiglione'd" once, you can add "Zoom." You can "zoom" anyone who isn't your neighbor, but you can't "zoom" a "zoom".
1. Next you can add "Schwarz", the blocking move. If you get passed something that you don't want, just say "Schwarz."
1. Next comes "Twizzler", a form of passing. Turn to one side, stick your butt out to the other side, and say "Twizzler". You've now passed it to whoever your backside is facing, much to the confusion of the person facing your front side.
1. Next is "Bork"ing. It's the same as "Profiglione", but it skips one person.
