A very short scene game, nice for ramping into longer scenes.

Directions:
1. One person starts on stage. Everyone else lines up as an audience, with one other person ready to join on stage.
2. The on-stage person starts making a motion with their body, without saying any words.
3. The next person joins them on stage and repeats that motion along with them.
4. The person who joined now says a line. That line will help the audience understand what it is they're doing together, and gift the first person enough information to respond.
5. The original person responds with a line.
6. The scene is done, everyone claps!
7. The original person leaves, and the joiner starts the next motion.

Variants:
You can also extend this to 3 lines. Sometimes that happens anyways! :) 

Alternate name: "Justify A Motion"
