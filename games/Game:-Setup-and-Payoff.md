This is a way of building up to players feeling comfortable making rhymes.

Directions:
1. Everyone sits or stands in a circle, and one person is the leader.
2. Round 2: categories. The leader starts by announcing a category name (e.g. "School"). Each person in the circle says a word related to that category, and you go around the circle twice.
3. Round 2: categories popcorn. The leader announces a new category, and then points at people who must respond with a related word. The goal is to practice being on the spot, get used to the feeling of pressure.
4. Round 3: setup & payoff. The leader announces a new category. This time, each person must first *think* of a related word and then think of a word that rhymes with that related word. Then they'll say aloud "RhymingWord-RelatedWord". This round goes in a circle, not popcorn style.
5. Round 4: blablabla. The leader announces a new category. This time, each person says "blablabla-RhymingWord, blablabla-RelatedWord" (literally "blablabla", with a little rhythm to it).
6. Round 6: couplets. The leader announces a new category. This time, each person comes up with a full rhyming couplet, like "He stepped up to the mat, and got ready to swing his bat!".
7. Round 7: pairs. This can be done as a performance or by splitting everyone into pairs. Two people pair off and are assigned a category. They come up with rhyming couplets, alternating back and forth. Optionally, the audience can yell out new categories every so often or every N rhymes.
