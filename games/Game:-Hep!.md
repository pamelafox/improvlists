Nearly the same game as [Oi, Oi, Oi](https://github.com/pamelafox/improvlists/blob/master/games/Game:-Oi,-Oi,-Oi,-Steady!.md).

Directions:
1. Everyone stands in a circle.
2. The first person turns to their side and makes a passing motion to the next person, yelling "Hep" as they do that.
3. That person then turns to their side and passes "Hep" to the next person. (Note: there is no receiving like in Pass The Clap, only passing.)
4. Once everyone has "Hep'd" once, you can start experimenting with blocking. If someone wants to block an "Hep" they cross their hands in front of their face and yell "Ho". That means the passer must turn to their other side and pass the "Hep" the other way.
6. Continue to your heart's delight. :)
