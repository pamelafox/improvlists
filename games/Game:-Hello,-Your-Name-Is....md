A game where **everyone** is trying to learn who they are.

Directions:
1. Each person takes a name tag and writing 3 things on it- a name, a profession, and a behavior that the person likes seeing in someone else. For example, "Jerry the Janitor, I like when you stare into my eyes." When they're done, they put their name tag face down in a pile.
2. The leader shuffles the name tags and gives one name tag to each person, placing it just under their neck so that they can't see what it says.
3. The leader tells them where they are - like a wedding or funeral, and they all stand up.
4. Everyone walks around the room. When they approach someone, they greet them by their name. They don't mention the other parts of the name tag explicitly, but they do make conversation and interact according to the tag, to help that person discover who they are and what they like.
5. Once enough milling around has happened, the leader calls everyone together into a circle. One at a time, each person guesses what's written on their tag. The others clap when they get it right, and they can also guess who wrote the tag.
