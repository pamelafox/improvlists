Directions:
1. Everyone stands in a circle.
2. The first person starts saying rhythmically "I'm digging a hole, I'm digging a hole, I'm digging a hole" while making the motion of digging a hole. Everyone joins in for the last two repeats of the phrase.
3. The next person makes up a new action, which must either rhyme with the previous action OR use the same motion with a completely different phrase. For example, "I'm bopping a mole, I'm bopping a mole" OR "I'm shoveling snow, I'm shoveling snow".
4. Continue around the circle like this for a few rounds.
5. (If you can handle it...) Announce that you're reversing! Go back around the circle in the opposite direction, repeating the actions from before. 
6. Reflect after on what made particular actions easier to remember than others.
