Directions:
1. Two players go on stage, and ask the audience for some CROW suggestion.
2. The players start acting out a scene.
3. At any point, an audience member can yell out "Rewind". When the players hear that, it's as if the scene was rewinded to one line of dialogue earlier, and they need to come up with a new line of dialogue instead.
4. Continue the scene until it reaches a logical conclusion.

Note: You can vary who gets to yell Rewind. You can have a designated director, you can let anyone yell, or you can rotate who gets to yell (by passing an object around).
