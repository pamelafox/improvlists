In this group game, you'll build up a fantastical object using the power of #YesAnd.

Directions:
1. Everyone stands around in a circle.
2. The leader places an object in the center of the circle.
3. They start by describing the object (factually or not). For example, "This is the Transmogrifier, guaranteed to transform sound waves into rainbows."
4. The next person continues, always starting with "Yes, and...". For example, "Yes and every so often, the rainbow will shoot out a little troll."
5. Continue going around the circle, adding more details around the object. You can go once around, twice around, or until it feels like you've reached a logical conclusion.
