This game comes from Mask theater, as it helps practice the skill of connecting to the audience with the eyes.

Directions:
1. Three players go up on stage and sit cross legged in a row.
2. Player 1 says "I have a X", while looking straight at the audience and holding X in their hands (such as "I have a ball"). Player 2 and 3 both look at Player 1 while they're speaking.
3. Player 2 says "A what??" while looking straight at the audience. Player 1 and 3 look at Player 2 while they're speaking.
4. Player 1 says "I have a X!" again, same as before.
5. Player 2 says "A what??" again, same as before.
6. Player 1 says "I have a X!" one more time.
7. Player 2 says "Ohhhh, an X" ("Ohhh, a ball"). Player 1 hands the object to Player 2.
8. Now Player 2 says "I have a X" to Player 3, and the cycle repeats.
9. Then Player 3 says it to Player 2, and Player 2 says it to Player 1.
10. Repeat as long as you'd like.

Note: This game is not actually about space object work, like holding the X in an accurate way. It's also not about characters and voices, like trying to make the dialogue interesting. It's purely about keeping the focus on whoever is speaking, and practicing looking directly at the audience while speaking.
