A punny game!

Directions:
1. Everyone sit or stand in a circle.
2. The leader suggests or asks for a theme, like "farm animals" and encourages everyone to spout out words or phrases related to farm animals, like "pigs", "hay", "egg laying", etc.
3. Now each person tries to come up with a pun of the form "185 ___ walked into a bar, ____", like "185 cows walked into a bar, everyone moooooved out of the way." Everyone else groans/claps.
4. If the leader notices that one person is struggling, they can ask them "what's a word you've been trying to make work?" and then ask everyone else to help generate puns for that word.
5. Continue making puns on that theme until you can groan no more.

Notes:
This can be done as a performance piece as well, with everyone lining up, asking the audience for the theme, and then calling out their punny sentences.
