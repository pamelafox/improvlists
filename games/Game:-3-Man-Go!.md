Cricket's favourite game - people talk for each other... player 1 is the voice for player 2, player 2 for 3, and 3 for 1. Play a scene by moving your lips and hoping to God the person being your voice says something intelligible, applicable, and doable. Then when the person you're talking for moves their lips, try to screw them over :)
