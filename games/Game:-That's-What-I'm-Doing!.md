Directions:
1. Two players go up on stage.
2. The audience gives them a suggestion for what activity they'll be doing, like "mowing the lawn", "rolling dice", etc.
3. One player starts by miming the activity and saying "I'm mowing the lawn, that's what I'm doing."
4. The second player copies the mime, but has to make up a new activity to accompany it, like "I'm pushing a baby stroller, that's what I'm doing."
5. The players continue, always with the same motion, trying to make up new activities to match that motion.
6. The audience members can yell out rules at any time, like "No more pushing things!" or "More childcare!", which forces the on-stage players to become more creative with their explanations.
7. The game continues until one player can't come up with a new activity. It's quite the mentally exhausting activity.
