A game to experiment with mini-scenes and what can emerge from just being given the "W" in CROW.

Directions:
1. Split into groups of three. Each group goes to their own part of the space.
2. In each group, one person will start by announcing a setting ("playground"). The other two people will act out a quick scene in that setting. The scene ends when a leader announces "scene" or when the setting giver calls it.
3. Then the next person announces a different setting, and the other two act out it.
4. Continue in this way, alternating who gives the setting, until you've been through a few rounds.
