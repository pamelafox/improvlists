This is a simple warm-up ice breaker, but it also carries an important message about groupwork in scenes.
Tip: you can ramp into this game from Body Walk.


Directions:
1. Everyone silently thinks of a single fun fact about themselves.
2. Everyone starts walking around the space. When someone encounters someone else, they introduce themselves and share their fun fact. They thank each other and find a new person to introduce themselves to.
3. Once everyone has shared their fun fact with each other person, everyone reconvenes in a circle. 
4. Now a leader points at each person and asks "Who are they?". Whoever remembers will share the name and fun fact of that person (which might be multiple people at once).
5. The leader shares the point of this game: "In improv scenes, we might not all remember everything about everyone else in a scene. But collectively, we probably do remember everything, and we depend on our teammates to bring back the information that they remember into a scene."
