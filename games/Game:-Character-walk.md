Directions:
1. Everyone starts walking around the room.
2. The leader instructs everyone: "Pick body part to lead their walk with, like elbow, nose, hip, etc. Imagine a character that walks like that. What do they do? What are they like? What's their name?"
3. After giving players enough time to get into that character, the leader asks everyone to stop and introduce themselves (as their character) to the player nearest them.
4. Then everyone comes into a circle and introduces themselves to the rest of the circle.
