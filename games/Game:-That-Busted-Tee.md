A fun generative warmup game.

Directions:
1. Everyone stands in a circle.
2. The leader teaches the song and rhythm to everyone else: 
"What's on that Busted Tee? What's on that Busted Tee, Say What!"
3. The first person turns to the person next to them, points to their shirt, and describes what's "on it", like: "It's a T-Rex munching thoughtfully on a strawberry".
4. The person next to them responds with a caption for the shirt, like "Deep Dino".
5. Everyone then sings the busted tee song.
6. The person who just came up with the caption is now the shirt describer, and the cycle continues.
7. Go around at least once, and if you're having fun, keep going. :)
