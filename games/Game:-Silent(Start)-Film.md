A short movie that starts off as a silent film. A good way to encourage collaborative action at the start of scenes.

Directions:
1. Two people go up on stage, the rest sit in the audience. One person is the timer / whistle blower.
2. They ask the audience for film title suggestions, and pick one to go with.
3. The players start acting out the first scene of the movie, *in silence*. The timer will blow a whistle after 45 seconds or what they deem to be an appropriate time.
4. Once the whistle blows, the players are *no longer in silence*, for the entire rest of the movie. The players continue acting out the first scene. The timer blows the whistle after another 45 seconds or when they deem best.
5. The timer announces "middle of the movie", and the players act out a scene from the middle of the movie, assuming some time has passed since the first scene. The timer will blow a whistle after 1min30seconds or when they deem best.
6. The timer announces "final scene of the movie", and the players act out the final scene, bringing the movie to its conclusion. If the scene doesn't reach an obvious end on its own, the timer can blow a whistle after 1min30seconds or when they deem best.

Variants:
You can mix in scenes with other characters to give the movie more variance.
