A long-form game.

Directions:
1. Two players go on stage. The other players (4-6) sit in a line of chairs along the side. A leader can time the scenes on the side as well.
2. The two players start acting. Their goal is to establish their characters and relationships - who are they, and who are they to each other? Establishing that will help the future players.
3. After 45 seconds (or some similar amount of time), the leader ends the scene. Player 1 leaves the stage to sit in the final chair, all the players in chairs move up a seat, and the player that pops off now joins Player 2 on stage.
4. Player 2 & Player 3 now start acting. Player 2 is the same character as they were in the first scene, but this new scene could be entirely unrelated to the first scene, depending on the relationship of Player 2 to Player 3. Once again, the goal is to establish who they are and how they relate to each other.
5. The leader ends the scene and the players rotate again. Each scene gives the audience new insight as to who each person is and how they're related to others in the scene.
6. The game can go through several rounds, depending on how long it takes for a story to develop amongst the players. The leader can end it at a good time, or decide to definitely end it after 2 or 3 rounds.
