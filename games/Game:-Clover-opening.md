This opening is often used by the Harold long-form improv format, but it can be used as an invocation for any set of scenes.

The general idea is that the players receive a single word from the audience, generate ideas related to the word, and come back to the word 3 times. This is why it's called "Clover" - the shape of the ideas away from the original word forms a clover shape.

Here's one way to teach it.

Directions:
1. Everyone sits or stands in a circle. Someone suggests a word.
2. The first player says that word.
3. The player next to them says a word related to that word. (Try to avoid making lists or synonyms).
4. This continues, with each player generating a new related word. In the back of their mind, everyone keeps in mind they have a goal of coming back to the original word.
5. Hopefully, a player will eventually say the original word. If other players can anticipate it, they all say it together with them.
6. This continues for another 2 rounds -- the players come back to the original word 2 more times.
7. Once you've said the word for the final time, the circle breaks, everyone leaves to the wings, and someone starts a scene inspired by the words from the clover.

Variations:
* If words feel "too" related (i.e. the players sound like they're making lists), you can also ask players to think of a related word silently in their head, and then say a word related to that silent one.
* Once players are comfortable generating related words, you can move onto generating ideas, phrases, and concepts. You can also generate ideas related to the last few ideas. Player 1 says a word, player 2 says a word, and player 3 says a phrase that relates those two ideas together. For example: "pirates", "rum", "the world's ancient alcoholic past". This tends to generate ideas that are easier to remember and leads to more scenes.
