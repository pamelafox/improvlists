A fun group warmup game.

Directions:
1. Everyone stand in a circle.
2. The first person says "I am..." and then makes up a superhero name based on an everyday activity they're good at, like "Captain Code-A-Lot" or "Wonder Walking Woman". They mimes out the activity as they're proclaiming their name.
3. Everyone else repeats back their superhero name and mimes the activity.
4. Go around the circle until everyone's had a chance to be a superhero.
