A fun warmup game. Pick whatever name is appropriate for your group.

Directions:
1. Everyone stands in a circle.
2. One person starts off as "Big Booty". The people to the left of them count off as "Number One", "Number Two", "Number Three", "Number Four", etc.
3. Everyone sings together "Awwww yeah, Big Booty Big Booty Big Booty, Awww yeah, Big Booty Big Booty Big Booty" while clapping or tapping the beat.
4. The current Big Booty starts off saying "Big Booty, Number X", where X is some valid number in the circle.
5. The current "Number X" must respond immediately (on the beat) with "Number X, Number Y", where Y is some other number.
6. If they mess up, either by waiting too long, forgetting to start with "Number X", or some other obvious mistake, everyone sings "Awwww shnap, Big Booty Big Booty Big Booty" while that player moves to the end of the circle. They now have the highest number, and other player's numbers change accordingly.
7. Everyone sings again "Awwww yeah, Big Booty Big Booty Big Booty, Awww yeah, Big Booty Big Booty Big Booty", and Big Booty begins again. 
8. Continue the game as long as you're having fun. You can also end as soon as Big Booty gets kicked out, and begin with that person the next time you play, if you regularly play this. That may take infinite time however!

Notes: This is one of the few competitive group games, and you can vary the rules to make it easier or harder. One way that people try to trick people is by staring at someone other than the number they're saying. If you're in a newbie group, you can declare that you have to make eye contact with the stated number. That makes it more of a game about eye contact and group coordination, and less of a competition.
