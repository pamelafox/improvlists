This game is a great way to conclude an improv session.

Directions:
1. Everyone sits in a circle and puts their hands in front of them in a prayer-like position.
2. Inform the circle that you will all now be recieving wisdom from the Great Colonel Kosai, who lived many billions of years ago and sends down wisdom to us mere mortals, one word at a time. 
3. The first person says a word.
4. The second person says a word.
5. People keep saying words until the group feels like the wise saying is complete. 
6. Then everyone puts their hands together and says "Yes yes yes yes yes".
7. The person after whoever ended the last saying then begins the next saying.
8. Continue until you feel filled up on wisdom for the night.

Note: Colonel Kosai doesn't always make sense. He works in mysterious ways. Trust the mystery.
