A fun short game.

Directions:
1. 3 players go up on stage. 3 players wait on the side.
2. The 3 players ask the audience for a suggestion for the name of a TV show.
3. Those players come up with a theme for that TV show, which often involves a little musical jingle.
4. The 3 waiting players now come up on stage, replacing the original 3. They act out a scene from the TV show, based on what they've learned from its theme.
5. Continue the game until all the players have had a chance.
