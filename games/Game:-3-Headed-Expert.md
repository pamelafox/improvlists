Directions:
1. 4 players go on stage. 3 of them stand or sit next to each other, and together they are the "expert". Player 4 is the interviewer.
2. The interviewer asks the audience what they should be the expert on (like mushroom mating, global warming, unicornification, etc).
3. The interviewer welcomes the expert, perhaps gifting them a name and background information, and asks the first question (like about their background or motivation).
4. The expert players answer the questions one word at a time.
5. The interviewer asks them another question.
6. The expert players answer this question one word at a time as well. They can either always start with the player that the last answer ended before, or they can start off with whoever wants to start, or they can always start on the left.
7. The interviewer can ask the audience for questions at this point.
8. Continue until you've had a good run of it.
