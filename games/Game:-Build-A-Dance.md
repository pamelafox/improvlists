Directions:
1. Everyone splits into pairs.
2. In each pair, Person A starts by making a simple dance move.
3. Person B copies the first dance move and then adds on a second dance move.
4. They continue copying the previous moves and making up one new move each turn.
5. At some point (hopefully before people's brains have exploded from trying to remember too much), the leader yells "Scene!", and the pairs stop making new moves.
6. Each pair now performs their duo dance for everyone else. Everyone applauds!
