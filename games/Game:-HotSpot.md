Directions:
1. Everyone stands in a circle.
2. One person starts by going in the center of the circle (the hot spot) and singing the lyrics of any song they know.
3. Anyone who knows the song joins in, supporting their singing.
4. Hopefully that song reminds someone in the circle of another song, and they then replace the person in the center and start singing the new song.
5. People keep replacing each other in the hot spot, until you all run out of songs to sing. :)
