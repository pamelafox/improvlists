Directions:
1. Two people go up on stage
2. The audience decide on their relationship. They may be people in a hierarchical relationship, like boss and employee, or they may be people in an equal relationship, like 2 surgeons. There might also be an obvious context for that relationship, like a police officer interrogating a perpetrator.
3. The audience decides who will start High Status and who will start Low Status. Throughout the scene, the person who starts High will lower their status, and the person who starts low will raise their status. Each person should look for opportunities to be changed by what their scene partner says or does.
4. Let the scene begin!
5. The scene ends either once they're both at peak High/Low or some other obvious concluding point.
