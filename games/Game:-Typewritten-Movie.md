A game that combines storytelling with acting. A good game to play after Typewritten Story.

Variant #1:
1. Three people go on stage, with one chair. The person in the chair starts off as the type. The other two people start off as the actors. Someone off stage has a sound-making device or the ability to yell "Switch!".
2. The typer begins (miming) typing and telling a story aloud. 
3. At some point, the sound-maker makes a sound.
4. At that point, the typer stops mid-sentence and the actors act out the story so far. They might decide to add more details, take a little further, etc.
5. When it seems like they've acted it out, the sound-maker makes a sound.
6. The typer swaps out with an actor, and the new typer begins typing, continuing the story.
7. The cycle continues until the story reaches a conclusion. The sound-maker can encourage a conclusion by declaring "Last round to wrap the story up!"

Variant #2:
Like the game above, except all three act out the scenes. In addition, you can number each person #1, #2, #3 to make it very clear what order they type in.
