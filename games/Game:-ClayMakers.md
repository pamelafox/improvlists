A fun warm-up game to gift each other with space objects.

Directions:
1. Everyone sits in pairs in chairs - facing each other, knees touching.
2. (In silence) Person A creates an object out of clay and then uses it.
3. Person A gives the object to person B, who will then use it and set it aside.
4. Now they switch, and Person B does the same.

Notes:
You can switch people up after one round, or let them go for a few rounds.
After a silent round, you can loosen the rules by letting them speak in gibberish and/or use sound effects.
