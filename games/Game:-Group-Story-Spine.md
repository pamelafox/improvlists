The Story Spine is a structure for telling stories, invented by Ken Adams. Before playing this game, write the spine on a whiteboard or large piece of paper:
* Once there was…
* And every day…
* Until one day…
* And because of that…
* And because of that…
* And because of that…
* Until finally…
* And so…

Directions:
* Everyone sit in a line of chairs facing the leader holding the Story Spine.
* The leader can introduce the Story Spine one phrase at a time, asking people popcorn style to finish the line.
* Tell the group that they'll be coming up with a bunch of stories in a row, using the Spine. After each story ends, everyone claps, regardless of how "good" the story is.
* Ask the first person in the line to start the story. You can point at the current line in the Spine, to make it clear what phrase they start with.
* Then the person next to them continues with the next line.
* Continue until the story is over and everyone claps.
* Tell as many stories as you have people in the group, so that everyone has a chance to start.

Notes:
If you have exactly 8 people, find a way to offset it so that different people start each time. The leader can join in as well.
