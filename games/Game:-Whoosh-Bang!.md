This is a game that's all about making up new rules. It's like the CalvinBall of improv warmup games!

Directions:
1. Everyone gets in a circle.
2. The first player says "Whoosh!" and makes a passing noise to their neighbor.
3. That player then passes it in the same direction, saying "Whoosh!".
4. If any player wants to pass it back, they can say "Bang!" and it reverses directions.
5. Once you have the basics done, anyone can start making up new rules, explaining them the first time around. 

Rule examples:
* Oil slick: the 2 neighboring players twirl and make bubbly noises, and the player after them is "it".
* Fire drill: everyone runs around screaming and switching places, the player that started it is still "it".
* Crab walk: point at another player, and they must crab walk to switch places with you. They're now "it".
