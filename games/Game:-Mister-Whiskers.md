This is a hilarious warmup game, designed to show people how failure can be fun.

Directions:
1. Everyone gets in a tight circle. Make sure there's enough space to run around the circle.
2. Leader instructs the group: "This is a passing game. When you want to pass across the circle, make eye contact with someone and say 'Mister Whiskers'. When you want to pass to your left, say 'Whiskey Mixers'. When you want to pass to your right, say 'Misty Vistas'." (Everyone will immediately start groaning, as they recognize the tongue twisters are setting them up for failure.)
4. Get everyone to practice each of the phrases until they feel comfortable (enough) with them.
5. Now instruct them: "If you mess up by saying the wrong phrase, you have to run around the circle and go back to your spot. Also, if you laugh, you have to run. SO ABSOLUTELY NO MESSING UP OR LAUGHTER! VERY SERIOUS GAME!" (Say this in such a way that they realize they will definitely be laughing)
6. Get everyone's initial giggles out.
7. Begin playing! If it gets passed to someone who has to run, then pass it to someone else. Keep it going any way you can, until you all die laughing.
8. Discuss the game after. The goal of the game is to show that failure can be fun, so hopefully that's what they experienced - but maybe they didn't - so ask them what it felt like when they had to run.

Variants:
* Everyone can use funny accents while passing. Even harder not to laugh.
* If you've got a tough crowd (one that's not laughing), you can make it harder by disallowing smiles - if you smile, you run.
