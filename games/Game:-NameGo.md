Before you play this game, everyone should know most everyone else's name. You can play "Name & Motion" before, or simply go around the circle and state names.

Directions:
* Stand in a circle.
* Person A makes eye contact with a person across the circle from them, and says their name. Person B must then say "Go". Once Person B has said go, Person A starts walking towards them. 
* Now Person B must receive permission to "go" from someone else in the circle, so he says someone else's name. If Person A arrives at Person B's spot before Person B leaves, then Person A can stand behind them.
* Continue playing like this, end whenever you've gotten your fill.

Notes:
The tricky part of this game is the moment when someone starts walking towards you. The instinct is to start walking yourself, but you can't do that until you've received permission. Try it, you'll see!
