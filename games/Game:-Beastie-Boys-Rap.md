Directions:
1. Everyone stands in a circle and starts singing "ba bum bum bum bum bum bum ba bum bum bum bum bum bum" (with a rap-like rhythm).
2. The first person starts by rapping "I'm thinking of a word that rhymes with ___", ending in some word like "trike".
3. Then everyone raps the ba bums.
4. The next person makes up a rhyme like "When I was a kid, I used to ride my trike", and everyone tries to yell out the final word at the same time ("trike!").
5. Keep going around the circle, with each person making up a rhyme and the group rapping ba bums after. If someone struggles, the group can keep rapping ba bums until they come up with something.
6. Whoever started that word is the final player to rhyme with that word.
7. The next person starts on a new word, "I'm thinking of a word that rhymes with___".
8. Continue until at least everyone has had a chance to start a word.
