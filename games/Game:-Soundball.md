A fun and easy group warm-up game.

Directions:
1. Everyone stands in a circle.
2. One person starts by throwing (overhand or underhand!) an invisible ball to someone else in the circle. As they throw it, they make an accompanying sound.
3. That person receives the ball, repeating the same sound.
4. Now that person sends a new ball (i.e. a new sound) to someone else.
5. Continue sending soundballs around.
6. When the leader wants to end the game, they can just receive the ball and put it away :)

Variant: You can also send words around ("Wordball"), or entire phrases. It can be nice to start with sounds and then lead to words and then phrases.
