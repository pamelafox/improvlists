These "Nope" games are designed to give improvisers a better sense of what suggestions they like and don't like. It will feel paradoxical for improv'ers that are accustomed to "yes-and"ing, but as you'll see, it results in interesting scenes.

Prereqs:

1. Start with a round of [What comes next?](https://github.com/pamelafox/improvlists/wiki/Game:-What-comes-next%3F).
2. Then get everyone to practice saying "Nope!" in a non-threatening way: high voice, wide-eyed.

Variant #1: Audience 
1. One person goes on stage as the puppet. They play "What comes next?" with the audience.
2. If the puppet doesn't like the suggestion, they can say "Nope!" and await another suggestion.

Variant #2: Master-Puppet
1. One person goes on stage as the puppet. Another person joins them as the master. (Optionally, the master can also act alongside the puppet, in a "We" adventure, like in [We are.. Suddenly!](https://github.com/pamelafox/improvlists/wiki/Game:-We-are...-Suddenly!)).
2. The puppet plays "What comes next?", asking the master each time and saying "Nope!" when they feel like it.

Variant #3: 2 Masters
1. One person goes on stage as the puppet. Two people join on either side of them, as masters. (They can also optionally participate in the action, like in #2).
2. The puppet plays "What comes next?", asking one master first. When they "Nope" one master, they will turn to the other and keep going with their suggestions until they "Nope" one of theirs.

Variant #3: 4 Masters
1. One person goes on stage as the puppet. Four people join on either side of them, two on each side, as masters. (They can also optionally participate in the action, like in #2).
2. The puppet plays "What comes next?", asking one master first. When they "Nope" one master, that master will rotate with the other master on that side. The puppet will turn to the other side and ask whatever master is there. 

Variant #4: Puppet Switch
1. Two people go on stage as dual puppet-masters.
2. One person starts "What comes next?", asking the other person. 
3. If that first puppet ever "Nope"s a suggestion, then the current master will become the puppet, asking them "What comes next?".
4. They continue switching every time a "Nope" happens.
