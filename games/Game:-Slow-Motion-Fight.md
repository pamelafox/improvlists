A handy technique for scenes.

Directions:
1. Everyone split into pairs.
2. Each pair starts off in pre-fight dialogue, like smack talking. At some point, one of the players will start throwing a punch, and both players go into slow motion mode. The other player receives the punch in slow motion, perhaps slowly falling to the ground. Once they recover, the pair returns to normal speed.
3. Switch pairs and do it again, this time with a slap.
4. Switch pairs and do it again, this time with a magical weapon.
