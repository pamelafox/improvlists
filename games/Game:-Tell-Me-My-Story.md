Tip: ramp into this game with a body walk, as that will give people an inspiration for a character to embody.

Directions: 
1. Everyone gets into pairs.
2. Person A has 1 minute to tell a story. Person B listens intently to the story.
3. Then Person B retells the story, while embodying a character. The facilitator can give specific inspiration for a character (like "silly" or "quiet") or encourage each person to invent their own character.
4. Person B tells a story, while Person A listens.
5. Person A retells the story, while embodying a character.
