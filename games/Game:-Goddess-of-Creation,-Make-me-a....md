A game to create quick and fun space objects / settings.

Directions:
1. Anyone starts by yelling out "Goddess of Creation, make me a..." and suggests something like "park picnic", "aerobics class",  "microwave". (It does not have to involve humans!)
2. Everyone else immediately jumps into position, working together without words to create something that looks like their request.
3. The original commander yells "Scene!" after a minute or so, when they feel it's been created.
3. Then someone else yells out a new command, and the game continues.

Notes:
You can add a restriction to the categories of things to be created, if you want a theme for some reason.
