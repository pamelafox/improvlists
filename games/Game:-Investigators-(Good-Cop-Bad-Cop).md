A secrets game, a bit trickier than other secrets games due to the asymmetry in the relationship.

Directions:
1. Three people go up on stage, the rest remain in the audience. One person will be the criminal, the other two will be the investigators. One chair is setup.
2. Instruct the criminal: "Your job will be to figure out what your crime was, and admit to it. Now go offstage and cover your ears until we call you back."
3. Now the investigators decides with the audience what their crime will be. For example, perhaps they bit Britney Spears on the neck, stole the Declaration of Independence, or captured the Muppets and set them free. Optionally, the investigators might briefly discuss ways to let the criminal in on the crime (puns to make, references to drop). 
4. Bring the criminal back in (by retrieving them or clapping them back).
5. The criminal sits in the chair, the investigators pace around them. 
6. The investigators start asking questions that reveal increasingly more about the crime. For example, if the crime was biting Britney Spears on the neck, they might say, "Why'd you do it? Were you just thirsty?" or "Oops, you did it again, aye??"
7. The criminal answers the questions as best as they can, and might even ask questions back.
8. The questioning continues until the criminal admits their crime. Everyone claps!
