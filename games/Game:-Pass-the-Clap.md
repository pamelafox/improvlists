A classic warmup game, a good training in eye contact and collaboration.

Directions:
1. Everyone stands in a circle.
2. The first person starts by making eye contact with the person to the left or right of them. Once they've made eye contact, they bring their hands together and clap, attempting to clap at the same time as each other.
3. The person who received the clap continues passing the clap in the same direction.

Variations:

You can add these in once everyone gets the basics. Ramp wisely!
* **Direction switch**: anyone can pass the clap back in the opposite direction.
* **Clap back**: if you clap twice, then you've passed it back to the person who passed it to you.
* **Across**: you can clap across the circle as well.
* **Duck**: you can duck before the clap makes it to you (before the eye contact happens). No double ducks.
* **Multiple claps**: you can start passing another clap while one is going. Warning: so hard.


Notes:

Emphasize the importance of eye contact **first**. This game is not a race, it's a rhythm.
