A warm-up game to in paying attention and letting go of control.

Directions:
1. Everyone splits into pairs.
2. One person in each pair starts as Person A, the other is Person B. (It could be the shortest person, person closest to door, etc).
3. When the leader tells everyone to begin, Person A starts making movements (of any size). Person B tries to be their mirror, mimicing their every move.
4. Person B continues mirroring Person A until the leader ends the round.
5. Round 2: Person B is now Person A. The pair repeats the exercise with the new dynamic until the leader ends the round.
6. Round 3: neither person is the strict leader or the follower. Each partner should lead at times and follow at times, depending on what they're feeling at the moment. Ebb and flow.
