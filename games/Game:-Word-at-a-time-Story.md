The goal of this story is to create entire stories, but to relieve the pressure on any one person feeling like they have to create a story. This is a good game to ramp into Sentence-at-a-time Story.

Directions:
1. Either 2-5 players go on stage, or the group divides into groups of 2-5.
2. The first player in a group starts with the word "Once".
3. Each player says one word of the story, in turn.
4. At some point, the players conclude the story either by saying "The" "End" or by realizing their story is definitely done. Alternatively, a leader can stop stories after an amount of time.
