A good way to ease into different ways of being. Great for ramping into character work. There's lots of ways to mix and match the rounds and variants for this game.

Round 1: Adjectives
1. The leader instructs everyone: "Start walking around the room. When I yell out an adjective, take on that adjective in your body, walk however it makes you feel."
2. The leader yells out the first adjective. Some adjective ideas: confident, shy, playful, elegant, athletic, sensual, jazzed, satisfied, calculating, paranoid.
3. The leader must decide if they want the group to walk normally between each adjective or transition immediately from one to the other. They can yell directions to freeze or blow a whistle or simply say another adjective, depending on their preference.
4. The leader cycles through adjectives until they feel satisfied (~6 is a good amount).

Round 2: Body Parts
1. The leader instructs everyone: "Start walking around the room normally."
2. The leader yells out an instruction to lead with a body part, such as: "Now walk as if your body is led by the top of your head. The top of your head is the first part of your body that enters the room." Body part ideas: chest, nose, hips, feet, stomach.
3. The leader cycles through body parts until they feel satisfied.

Round 3: Body Ticks
1. Like above, but the leader instructs the group to walk with some sort of idiosyncratic body movement, such as "be jittery", "use your hands excessively", "hide your hands", "always be tapping your legs to a beat."

Variant: Conversation
At any point during the walks, the leader can instruct the group to start making sounds from their mouth, to see what sounds correspond to such a walk. On the next turn, the leader tells them that they can actually start conversing with each other, as if they're the character that's emerged from that particular walk. If the characters seem particularly compelling, the leader can stop the walk then and get all the characters in a circle to introduce themselves.
