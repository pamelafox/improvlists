A fun warmup game to train our spontaneous generation impulses.

Directions:
1. Every stands in a circle.
2. One person starts by turning to the person next to them and saying "Three things that...", like "Three things that you wear on your head" or "Three jobs that you can have on Mars".
3. That person then replies by listing off 3 answers. **Important**: They do NOT need to be truthful answers. They don't have to make sense. They just need to come out of your mouth!
4. Then everyone yells "3 Things" while moving their fists up & down in front of them.
5. Repeat 2-4 until you've had your fill.

Variants:
* You can slow down the rhythm of answering by having everyone together yell "1" after their first answer, then "2" after their second, then "3 Things!" after their third. That also helps keep people more engaged when it's not their turn.
* You can ramp up the difficulty by making it 4 Things or 5 Things. Then people will really realize that the answers do NOT need to be truthful answers!
