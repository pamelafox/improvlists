Directions:
1. 3-4 people go up on stage and arrange themselves in chairs *not* facing each other.
2. The players ask the audience for a suggestion of their relationship to each other - like colleagues at a company, family members, members of a particular club.
2. One player starts writing an email aloud, with a "to", "subject", and "body". When they're done, they say "SEND".
3. Another player writes an email, perhaps as a "reply" or "reply all". They say "send" when they're done.
4. The players continue writing emails, staying as the same character throughout.
5. End whenever you see fit.
