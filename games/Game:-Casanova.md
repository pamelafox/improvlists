Directions:
1. One player goes on stage and sits in a chair. 
2. Two pairs of two people go up on stage and join them, each pair standing at either side. Their goal is to come up with a pickup line, one word-at-a-time, that will impress the sitting player.
3. The players ask the audience for a noun suggestion, like "cardboard" or "caveman". That suggestion will inspire their pickup lines.
4. One pair starts, with the inner player saying the first word of the pickup line (often "hey").
5. Their partner says the next word, and they continue back and forth until the pickup line is clearly done. One way to make that clear is to say "yeahhhhh" at the end, in a sufficiently skeezy manner.
6. The next pair now comes up with their pickup line.
7. The player in the chair picks their favorite line.
8. In each pair, the players switch position. They come up with another line, with the other player saying the first word.
9. The player in the chair picks their favorite line, once again.
