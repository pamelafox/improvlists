The goal of this story is to create entire stories, but to relieve the pressure on any one person feeling like they have to create the whole story. This is a good game to play after Word-at-a-time-Story.

Directions:
* Either 2 players go on stage, or everyone splits into pairs of pairs.
* The first player in a pair comes up with the first sentence of the story, starting with "Once upon a time..."
* The second player comes up with the next sentence, and they keep alternating.
* At some point, the players conclude the story by saying "The End". Alternatively, a leader can stop stories after an amount of time.
