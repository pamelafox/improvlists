This is a way of presenting a series of scenes, usually seeded by an idea generator like [The Living Room](https://github.com/pamelafox/improvlists/blob/master/games/Game:-The-Living-Room-(Idea-Generator).md).

Directions:
1. The players wait on the side of the stage.
2. One player goes on stage, and motions to any other players they want to bring on with them. They begin a scene.
3. Meanwhile, the offstage players are waiting for a good moment to "edit" the scene. One way they can edit is by replacing a player (by tapping them out), and starting a new scene related to the remaining character on stage. Another way is to replace the entire scene by "swiping", running across with a hand gesture swiping down. If they swipe, they must start the next scene.
4. The players keep going through scenes like this, getting edited whenever the offstage players have an idea, and perhaps returning to scenes or ideas from before.
5. The scene montage ends after a certain period of time or after a logical concluding scene.
