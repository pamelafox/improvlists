A game to practice shifting the focus in a scene from one player to another. A good game to warm-up before other scene work.

Round 1: Giving 
1. Everyone stands distributed around the room. 
2. One person starts walking around the room, silently.
3. When they're ready to give focus to another person, they use eye contact to convey that. When the other person starts moving, the original person stops moving. Only *one* person should be moving at any time.
4. The players continue giving focus until you decide to end the round (perhaps after everyone's given focus a few times).

Round 2: Taking
1. Everyone stands distributed around the room.
2. Once again, one person starts walking around the room silently.
3. This time, someone else must decide to take focus, and they must silently convey that to the currently walking person somehow.
4. Once the original person realizes that they've had their focus taken away from them, they stop moving.
5. The players continue taking focus from each other until you decide to end the round.

Round 3: Giving & Taking
1. Everyone stands distributed around the room.
2. Again, one person starts walking around the room silently.
3. This time, they can choose to give the focus to someone else *or* someone else can choose to take the focus away from them. Either way, the goal is for the audience to not know whether they're witnessing a give or a take - the goal is for it to be seamless.
4. (Optional) The leader can call one player out to watch for a few give/takes, eventually subbing all the players out. That can provide better feedback to help the players improve their movements.
5. The players continue giving and taking focus from each other until you decide to end the round.
6. Reflect on the practice with the players and the audience.

Notes:
Before playing this game, you can measure the focus changeability of the group with this game: everyone walks around, one person starts telling a story, another person interjects and continues telling, until the story is done. You'll likely find that the transitions aren't so seamless, and that can help motivate the give/take focus game. You could also then try playing that game after, and see if anything's changed.
