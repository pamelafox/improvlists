Directions:
1. 4-6 players go up on stage.
2. Each player recieves a word from the audience, often a fairly common word.
3. Some combination of players start the scene. Then, players have to either exit when they hear their word, or if they were offstage, they must enter when they hear their word. When they enter or exit, they always justify why they've done so.
4. Continue playing until the scene ends.
