A fast-paced game to practice moving around space objects.

Directions:
1. 2 people go up on stage. One is the robber (or James Bond). The other is the cop (or the villain). 
2. The robber starts off running away from the cop. As they run away across the stage, they run into obstacles - closed doors, rivers, ladders, etc. They mime their way through the obstacles, trying to make it clear to the cop what the obstacle is.
3. The cop then chases after the robber, half a stage width behind. They imagine the same obstacles in front of them and figure out how they'll get through them.
4. When the robber gets to the end of the stage, they run back the other way, running into new obstacles.
5. The game ends when one of them gives up (often due to exhaustion!).

Notes:
It helps if the players slow down the chase scene, enough for the audience and chaser to understand the space obstacles being created. It also helps if the chasee only runs into one obstacle during each stage width.
