A good game to practice being on the spot and coming up with things to say.

Directions:
1. Around 4 players go up on stage, and one other player nearby will be the "pointer".
2. The players get a suggestion from the audience for a product that could have an instruction manual. Simple is good, like a pencil.
3. The players start with the Welcome section of the manual. The pointer points at one player and they start talking. They then point at another player, who starts from where the last person got cut off, and they keep talking. 
4. At some point, the players end a section and add the audience for a suggestion of another section of the manual, like "repair" or "FAQs". (Or, the pointer can give them the suggestion).
5. End the manual whenever you think is a good time.
