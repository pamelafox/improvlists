Directions:
1. Two people go up on stage.
2. They ask the audience for some CROW (character/relationship/objective/where).
3. They start acting out the scene.
4. At any point, someone in the audience can yell "Freeze!" The two players freeze in place, and the yeller goes up and replaces one of them.
5. They unfreeze and continue acting out the scene.
6. The freezing and acting continues until the scene reaches its epic conclusion.


Variants:
* You can also change the genre as you're changing the actors. Whenever someone yells "Freeze", someone else in the audience will yell out a new genre.
