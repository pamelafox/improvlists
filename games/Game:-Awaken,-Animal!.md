A game in paying attention to each other.

Directions:
1. Everyone lies on the floor with their eyes closed, curled in a sleeping condition.
2. When the leader says to awaken, each player slowly awakens. Their goal is to act as an animal, and for all of them to act as the same animal, by gradually mirroring each other. They do not communicate in words, they simply look for cues in body language (and optionally sounds).
3. The leader ends the game when it seems like the players have converged on an animal.
