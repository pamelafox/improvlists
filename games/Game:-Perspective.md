A useful technique for scene work.

Round 1: Above-Below
1. Either split everyone into pairs, or have one pair go on stage while the audience watches.
2. Both players are facing the audience. However, in their scene world, one player in the pair is on a surface above the other player - like on a roof with the other on the ground. The player on the roof will likely be looking downwards while the player on the ground will look upwards.
3. They pair act out a scene together.

Round 2: Same-Level
1. Once again, both players are facing the audience. In their scene world, the players are on the same level, but they are far apart from each other - like a father throwing a ball to his son. That means that if one player throws a ball to the other player, it will take some time to get there.
2. The pair act out a scene together.
