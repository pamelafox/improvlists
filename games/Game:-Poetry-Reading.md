This is a game of gifting and interpretation.

Directions:
1. Three people go on stage. The person on the left is the poet, the second person is their translator, and the third person is the signer.
2. They ask the audience for 2 suggestions: 1) where is the poet from? It can be a real country, made up place, or even an alternate dimension, 2) what is the title of the poem?
3. The translator gives a grand introduction to the poet and the poem they'll be reading.
4. The poet says the first line of the poem, in the made up language of their country. It should *not* sound like intelligible words.
5. The translator translates it into English (or whatever language everyone speaks). At the same time (or slightly after), the signer "signs" the translation.
6. Once the signer is done, the poet says the next line of their poem.
7. The poetry reading continues until the poem has reached its epic conclusion.

Notes:
* Make sure the poet gives enough time for the signer to finish. The poet also shouldn't be making any body language themselves, as that doesn't give the translator enough room for interpretation.
* An alternative to signing is to have an interpretive dancer.
